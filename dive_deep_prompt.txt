Human: Here is a statement of a new law:

<law>
  {{text}}
</law>

Here is knowledge base information relevant to the statement:

<knowledge_base_info>
  {{knowledge_base_info}}
</knowledge_base_info>

Look for divergences between the user provided text and the knowledge bases, and for every divergence, list them.
List them in JSON format using the following example:
<example>
{
  "statement": "The statement text",
  "justification": "The justification for the classification"
}
</example>

Write only the JSON content and nothing else.
