00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,880
Amazon Textract Overview.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,410
Amazon Textract is a document analysis service

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,780
that detects and extracts printed text,

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:15,500
handwriting, structured data, and tables from images and

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,580
and scans of documents without requiring templates or configuration.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,540
Amazon Textract uses

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,280
machine-learning models that have been trained on millions of documents,

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,810
so virtually any document type you upload is automatically recognized

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,400
and processed for text extraction.

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,200
Upon extraction,

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,660
the server returns a confidence score for each element it identifies,

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:52,170
so that you can evaluate how you want to use the results.

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,400
All extracted data

14
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,830
is returned with bounding box coordinates,

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,600
which is a rectangular frame

16
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,270
that fully encompasses

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,260
each piece of data identified,

18
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,690
so that you

19
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,290
can quickly identify

20
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,140
where a word or number

21
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,860
appears on a document.

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,830
You can access these features with

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,390
the AWS Management Console,

24
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,930
the AWS Command Line Interface,

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,700
or the Amazon Textract API.

26
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,500
Benefits.

27
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,270
Beyond OCR.

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,900
Amazon Textract uses optical character recognition

29
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,300
to automatically detect data

30
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:39,330
in a scan or rendering of a document, such as a legal document or a scan of a book.

31
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,470
Textract then extracts text, relationships,

32
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,610
and structure.

33
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,760
Document processing.

34
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,160
You can quickly automate document processing

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,060
and act on the information extracted,

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,610
whether you're automating loan processing

37
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,390
or extracting information from invoices

38
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,820
and receipts.

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,700
Textract can extract the data

40
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,190
in minutes or hours instead of days.

41
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,090
Application integration.

42
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,740
Amazon Textract simplifies building text detection capabilities

43
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,700
into your applications by using the Amazon Textract text APIs.

44
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,080
You don't need computer vision or deep-learning expertise.

45
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,410
Human reviews.

46
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,520
Insert

47
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,840
human reviews to provide oversight of your models

48
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,990
and manage

49
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,750
sensitive workflows using

50
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,910
Amazon Augmented AI, or A2I.
