Amazon CodeWhisperer Overview

2
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:11,250
Amazon CodeWhisperer is a general purpose,
machine learning-powered code generator, that provides you with code recommendations in real time.

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:19,041
As you write code, CodeWhisperer
automatically generates suggestions based on your existing code and comments.

4
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:28,083
Your personalized recommendations can
vary, in size and scope, ranging from a single line comment to fully formed functions.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,291
CodeWhisperer can also scan your code to
highlight, and define security issues.

00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,125
Features

7
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,708
Get more done faster

8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,916
CodeWhisperer is trained on billions of
lines of code and can generate full function code suggestions.

9
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,583
Bypass time-consuming coding tasks and
accelerate building with unfamiliar APIs.

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,875
Code with confidence

11
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,250
CodeWhisperer can flag or filter code
suggestions that resemble open source training data.

12
00:01:04,249 --> 00:01:11,416
Get the associated open source projectâ€™s
repository URL and license so that you can more quickly review them, and add attribution.

13
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,333
Enhance code security

14
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:22,583
Scan your code to detect hard-to-find
vulnerabilities, and get code suggestions to remediate them immediately.

15
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:32,041
Align to best practices for tackling
security vulnerabilities, such as those outlined by Open Worldwide Application Security Project.

16
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,625
Security scans

17
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:44,000
Run Security Scan performs a security scan
on currently an active file and its dependent files in the IDE editor.

18
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:52,250
After the scan is finished, security
issues in the scanned files are highlighted in the Problems panel in the IDE editor.

19
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:58,291
CodeWhisperer's security scan is
integrated with Amazon CodeGuru.

20
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:06,166
CodeGuru does multiple layers of filtering
before scanning code to ensure that you can focus on the most critical issues.

21
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:09,916
View code references

22
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:19,958
CodeWhisperer learns, in part, from open
source projects. Sometimes, a suggestion it's giving you might be similar to a specific piece of training data.

23
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:26,166
You can view references to code
recommendations that are similar to training data.

24
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,541
Turn code references off and on

25
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:35,750
With the reference log, you can view
references to code recommendations.

26
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:41,875
You can also update and edit code
recommendations suggested by CodeWhisperer.

27
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:49,166
In some cases, you can, at the enterprise
level, opt out of receiving code recommendations.

28
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,958
IDEs supported by Amazon CodeWhisperer

29
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:05,125
CodeWhisperer can be used in the following
integrated development environments - Visual Studio Code, Amazon Sagemaker Studio, JetBrains, and JupyterLab.

30
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,875
CodeWhisperer runs in AWS Cloud9, an IDE
offered by AWS as a service.

31
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:19,000
You need an AWS account to use it, and you
use it inside your web browser.

32
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:25,583
CodeWhisperer is integrated in AWS Lambda,
an AWS Compute service.

33
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:32,500
You need an AWS account to use it, and
you use it on the AWS Management console.

34
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,458
You can use CodeWhisperer to help you
write those functions.

35
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,166
Language support in Amazon CodeWhisperer

36
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,541
CodeWhisperer fits the way that you work.

37
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,583
CodeWhisperer supports code generation for
15 programming languages.

38
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,875
The accuracy and quality of the code
generation for a programming language depends on the size and quality of the training data.

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,750
In terms of the quality of the training
data, the programming languages with the most support include Java, Python, JavaScript, and C#.
