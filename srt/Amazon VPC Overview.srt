00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Overview.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,840
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,420
Amazon VPC is like your own private cloud within the AWS Cloud.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,560
It lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud,

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,870
where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,130
This is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,020
Alternatively, your AWS account comes with a preconfigured default VPC in each Region.

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,050
You can launch your resources into the default VPC right away.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,960
Amazon VPC also provides you with complete

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,360
control over your virtual networking environment,

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,940
including selection of your own IP address range,

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,160
creation of subnets,

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,930
and configuration of route tables and network gateways.

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,720
To get started with creating a VPC,

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,690
you must assign it with a range of private IP addresses.

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,060
Amazon VPC supports IPv4 and IPv6.

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,340
Your resources can communicate over IPv4 or IPv6 or both.

18
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,200
By default, it uses the IPv4 addressing protocol.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,060
You can also bring your own IP prefixes.

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,060
A VPC spans all of the Availability Zones in the Region.

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,350
After creating a VPC, you can add one or more subnets in each Availability Zone.

22
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,080
A subnet is a partition of a VPC's IP address range.

23
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,070
For example,

24
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,360
your VPC has a total of 1,024 IP addresses, and you configure four subnets.

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,990
Each has 251 IP addresses.

26
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,270
Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone.

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,150
You can launch instances into subnets in multiple Availability Zones

28
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,390
to improve fault tolerance and hence building highly available applications.

29
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,680
Creating multiple VPCs is supported.

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,470
In one AWS account,

31
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,840
you can create up to five VPCs per Region by default.

32
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,130
If more is required, this limit can be increased through AWS Support.

33
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,220
Now let's talk about the key benefits of Amazon VPC.

34
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,600
First, it is simple.

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,050
Using the AWS Management Console,

36
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,610
VPC can be quickly and easily created.

37
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,100
You spend less time setting up and managing,

38
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,220
so you can concentrate on building the applications that run in your VPCs.

39
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,990
Customizable.

40
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,320
You can easily customize the network configuration of your Amazon VPC.

41
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,200
For example,

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,450
you can create a public-facing subnet for your

43
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,720
web servers that have access to the internet.

44
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,930
You can also place your backend systems such as databases or

45
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,840
application servers in a private-facing subnet with no internet access.

46
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,330
When you configure VPC to connect to your corporate network,

47
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,050
it can serve as an extension of your own data center.

48
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,650
In addition, VPC can also be connected to other VPCs.

49
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,950
Secure.

50
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,000
Amazon VPC provides multiple layers of advanced security features

51
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,000
such as network access control lists, or NACLs,

52
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,320
and security groups to enable inbound and outbound filtering

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,200
at the subnet and instance level.

54
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,420
In addition,

55
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,840
you can store data in Amazon S3 and restrict access

56
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,410
so that it's only accessible from instances inside your VPC.
