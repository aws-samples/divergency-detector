00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,450
Amazon Athena Overview.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,190
Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,860
analyze data stored directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service, or Amazon S3.

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,350
With Athena, you can remove the need for complex extract,

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,080
transform, and load, or ETL jobs to prepare your data for analysis.

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,740
Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage,

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,810
and the pay-per-query feature means that you only pay for the queries that you run.

8
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,460
Amazon Athena Benefits.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,610
Fast performance.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,680
With Amazon Athena,

11
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,970
your application engineers don't need to worry

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,380
if enough compute resources have been allocated.

13
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,340
Athena automatically scales and runs queries in parallel.

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,760
So even for large datasets,

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,460
most results are returned within seconds.

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,470
Open standards.

17
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,519
Athena uses Presto, an open-source distributed query engine

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,660
that supports structured query language, or SQL.

19
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,770
Athena works with a variety of standard data formats

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,390
including CSV, JSON, and Apache Parquet.

21
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,420
Athena can perform complex analysis, including large joins,

22
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,930
window functions, and array manipulations.

23
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,770
Pay per query.

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,930
With Athena,

25
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,020
you pay only for the queries that you run based on the amount of data scanned.

26
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,300
By compressing your data into gamma formats,

27
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,700
you can achieve additional savings

28
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,230
and get better performance from your queries.

29
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,900
Amazon Athena Features.

30
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,260
Secure.

31
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:54,460
Amazon Athena is integrated with AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM.

32
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,350
IAM policies can be used to grant users access to Athena's functionality.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,040
Another option is to use access control lists, or ACLs,

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,650
or Amazon S3 bucket policies that attach directly

35
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,820
to an S3 bucket or its objects.

36
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,770
You can also use Athena to query encrypted data stored in Amazon S3

37
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,320
and write encrypted results back to your S3 bucket.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,140
Integrated.

39
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,900
Athena integrates out of the box with AWS Glue.

40
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:31,820
You can use the AWS Glue data catalog to create a unified metadata repository

41
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,490
that includes the location, schema, and metrics

42
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,840
for your data sources and targets.

43
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,640
You can use the fully managed ETL capabilities of AWS Glue

44
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,740
to crawl datastores and discover new or updated schemas,

45
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,840
making it easier to query data using Athena.

46
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,930
Federated query.

47
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,900
Athena provides connectors for enterprise

48
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,840
data sources, including Amazon DynamoDB,

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,980
Amazon Redshift, MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases,

50
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,960
and other popular third-party datastores.

51
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,290
You can use Athena data connectors

52
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,570
to generate insights from multiple data sources by using standard SQL syntax,

53
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,640
removing the need to move your data with ETL scripts.
