00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,200
AWS CodeDeploy Overview.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,000
AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,420
that automates software deployments to a variety of compute services

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,060
such as Amazon EC2,

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,280
AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, and your on-premises servers.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,060
It eliminates the need for error-prone manual operations.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,400
You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of application content,

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,140
including code, AWS Lambda functions,

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,920
web and configuration files, executables,

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,820
packages, scripts, and multimedia files.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,240
AWS CodeDeploy can deploy application content that runs on a server

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,880
and is stored in Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub or Bitbucket repositories.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,740
AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,740
It helps you avoid downtime during application deployment

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,430
and handles the complexity of updating your applications.

16
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:04,499
The service scales with your infrastructure to match your deployment needs.

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,600
Here are the key benefits: automated deployments.

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,540
AWS CodeDeploy fully automates your software deployments

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,060
allowing you to deploy reliably and rapidly.

20
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,960
You can consistently deploy your application across your development,

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,030
test, and production environments.

22
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:28,030
Centralized control.

23
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,440
AWS CodeDeploy allows you to easily launch and track

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,680
the status of your application deployments

25
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,020
through the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.

26
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,880
CodeDeploy gives you a detailed report allowing you to view when and to where

27
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,060
each application revision was deployed.

28
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,160
You can also create push notifications

29
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,460
to receive live updates about your deployments.

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,560
Minimize downtime:

31
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,780
AWS CodeDeploy helps maximize your application availability

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,760
during the software deployment process.

33
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,840
It introduces changes incrementally

34
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,940
and tracks application health according to configurable rules.

35
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,020
Software deployments can easily be stopped

36
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,890
and rolled back if there are errors.

37
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,680
Easy to adopt:

38
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,440
AWS CodeDeploy is platform- and language-agnostic.

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,500
It works with any application

40
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,240
and provides the same experience, whether you're deploying to Amazon EC2,

41
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,100
AWS Fargate, or AWS Lambda.

42
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:33,999
You can easily reuse your existing setup code.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,680
or continuous delivery tool chain,
CodeDeploy can also integrate with your existing software release process

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,800
or continuous delivery tool chain,

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,866
for example, AWS CodePipeline, GitHub and Jenkins.
