00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Overview - Storage and Networking.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,960
Amazon EC2 provides you with flexible, cost-effective,

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,940
and easy-to-use data storage options for your instances.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,650
Instances can access storage from disks

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,000
that are physically attached to the host computer.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,910
This disk storage is referred as instance store,

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,130
which provides temporary block-level storage for your instance.

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,440
You can also attach an Amazon Elastic Block Storage, or EBS,

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,190
volume to your EC2 instance for persistent block-level storage.

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,440
EBS behaves like a raw, unformatted

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,860
external block device.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,060
Your EBS data can be backed up using EBS snapshots and stored in Amazon S3.

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:48,220
Amazon EC2 also uses Amazon S3 for storing Amazon Machine Images, or AMIs.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,510
In addition,

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,020
you can also create a file system for use with Amazon EC2.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,740
Amazon Elastic File System, or EFS, provides scalable file storage.

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,100
Applications running on your EC2 instances can access your file system at the same time.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,100
Networking defines your network access to your EC2 instances.

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,460
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC,

20
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,640
lets you provision a logically isolated area within the AWS Cloud,

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,120
where you can launch your EC2 instances in a virtual network that you define.

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,350
Alternatively, your AWS account comes with a

23
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,930
preconfigured default VPC in each region.

24
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,410
You can launch your EC2 instances into the default VPC right away.

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,860
A VPC can also span multiple Availability Zones, or AZs, in a region.

26
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,260
You can add subnets in different AZs and launch instances

27
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,590
into the subnets to improve fault tolerance in your applications.

28
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,040
You can also use multiple layers of security to help control access to

29
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,440
Amazon EC2 instances in each subnet.

30
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,600
For example, you can define a security group

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,630
which acts as a virtual firewall that controls the traffic for your instances.

32
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,160
Now, let's look at how these EC2 basic concepts

33
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,780
are used to launch Amazon EC2 instances.

34
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,590
To launch Amazon EC2 instances, first,

35
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,260
you need to determine whether you want to run your Amazon EC2 instances

36
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,520
in a single location or multiple locations, regions,

37
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,770
availability zones.

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,460
Select an Amazon Machine Image, or AMI.

39
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,420
Then determine which Amazon EC2 instance types and sizes you want.

40
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,600
You will also need to configure network access and

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,360
specify any preferred subnet on your Amazon EC2 instances.

42
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,830
A default route storage is used to boot the instance.

43
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,940
You can edit the root volume or attach additional storage to your instances.

44
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,730
As an option,

45
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,590
you can add tags to your instances.

46
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,530
Tags are used to categorize your resources and

47
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,700
help in searching and managing your resources.

48
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,680
Configure security on your Amazon EC2 instances

49
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,610
such as configure security groups.

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,330
You can also secure your login information for your instances using key pairs:

51
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,810
public and private key.

52
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,130
With these simple steps, you can use Amazon EC2

53
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,370
to launch as many or as few instances as you need within minutes.
