1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,660
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Features.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,020
Here are the key features.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,370
Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,440
Elastic Volumes allows you to dynamically increase capacity,

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,230
tune performance, and change volume types with no downtime or performance impact.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,880
Simply create a volume with the capacity and performance needed today,

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,800
knowing you have the ability to modify your volume configuration in the future,

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,810
saving hours of planning cycles.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,710
By using Amazon CloudWatch with AWS Lambda,

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,490
you can automate volume changes to meet the changing needs of your applications.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,990
Amazon EBS-Optimized Instances.

12
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,960
You can launch certain EC2 instance types as EBS-optimized instances.

13
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,260
EBS-optimized instances

14
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:51,580
deliver dedicated throughput between Amazon EC2 and Amazon EBS with options

15
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,340
between 500-19,000 megabits per second, depending on the instance type used.

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,480
The dedicated throughput minimizes contention between Amazon EBS I/O

17
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,650
and other traffic from your EC2 instance,

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,540
providing the best performance for your EBS volumes.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,720
Amazon EBS Snapshots.

20
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,280
You can back up the data on your Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon S3

21
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,260
by taking point-in-time snapshots

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,520
to enable disaster recovery. Snapshots are incremental backups,

23
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,280
which means that only the blocks on the device that have changed are saved.

24
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,550
You can create one or multiple new EBS volumes

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,150
based on a snapshot and resize Amazon EBS volumes.

26
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,840
The following are the key features for Amazon EBS Snapshots.

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,250
Direct read access.

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,200
You can use EBS direct API to read data off snapshots.

29
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,560
This makes it easy to track incremental changes between two EBS snapshots,

30
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,200
without needing to create the EBS volumes and EC2 instances.

31
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,740
You can create EBS snapshots from any block storage, regardless of where it resides,

32
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,640
including data on premises.

33
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,360
In addition, after a volume is created from EBS snapshots, your attached

34
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,350
instance can have immediate access to the Amazon EBS volume data.

35
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,789
If you enable fast snapshot restore, or FSR, capability,

36
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,390
EBS volumes restored from FSR-enabled

37
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,160
snapshots instantly receive their full performance.

38
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,460
EBS snapshots can also be shared across AWS accounts

39
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,990
and copied across AWS Regions, enabling geographical expansion.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,900
In addition,

41
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,360
when you delete a snapshot, only the data unique to that snapshot is removed.

42
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,330
Data Lifecycle Manager, or DLM, for EBS snapshots

43
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,460
provides a simple, automated way to back up data stored on EBS volumes

44
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,030
by ensuring that EBS snapshots are created and deleted on a custom schedule.

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,390
Snapshots are cleaned up regularly to keep costs under control.

46
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,520
Simply tag your EBS volumes and start creating lifecycle policies

47
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,780
for creation and management of backups.

48
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,600
You can also use CloudWatch events to monitor your policies

49
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,470
and ensure that your backups are being created successfully.

50
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,560
With no additional fee, Amazon EBS Multi-Attach

51
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,860
enables you to attach a single provisioned IOPS SSD

52
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,680
io1 volume to up to 16 Nitro-based

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,700
EC2 instances within the same Availability Zone.

54
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,800
Each attached instance has full read-and-write permission to the shared volume.

55
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,730
Multi-Attach makes it easier to achieve higher application availability

56
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,330
for applications that manage storage consistency for multiple writers.
