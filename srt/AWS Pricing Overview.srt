00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's look at AWS pricing and the AWS
Pricing Calculator.

2
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:09,875
AWS offers you a pay-as-you-go approach
for pricing for over 160 cloud services.

3
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:18,208
With AWS you pay only for the individual
services you need, for as long as you use them and without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing.

4
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:24,208
AWS pricing is similar to how you pay for
utilities like water and electricity.

5
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:30,958
You only pay for the services you consume
and once you stop using them, there are no additional costs or termination fees.

6
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:39,583
The AWS Pricing Calculator lets you
explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS.

7
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:44,000
This enables you to make informed
decisions about using AWS.

8
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,041
How do you pay for AWS?

9
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:54,583
Pay-as-you-go allows you to easily adapt
to changing business needs without overcommitting budgets and improving your responsiveness to changes.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,166
Commit to save

11
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:06,166
For AWS Compute and AWS Machine Learning,
Savings plans offer savings over on-demand in exchange for a commitment to use a specific amount of a service.

12
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:13,541
Usage is measured in dollars per hour of
an AWS service, or a category of services, for a one or three year period.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,583
Pay less by using more

14
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:21,875
You can get volume-based discounts and
realize important savings as your usage increases.

15
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:28,666
For services such as S3, pricing is
tiered. meaning the more you use, the less you pay per gigabyte.

16
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:35,875
Whether you are running a single instance,
or dozens of individual services, with the AWS Pricing Calculator,

17
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,750
you can model your solutions before
building them.

18
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:46,041
Explore the price points and calculations
behind your estimate and find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs.

19
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:52,541
With transparent pricing, you can see the
math behind the price for your service configurations.

20
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:58,500
You can use hierarchical estimates to see
and analyze service costs grouped by different parts of your architecture.

21
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:06,166
You can save each estimate's unique link
to share or revisit directly through your browser, and you can export your estimate to a CSV file.

22
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:14,958
The calculator is useful both for people
who've never used AWS, and for users who want to reorganize or expand their AWS usage.
