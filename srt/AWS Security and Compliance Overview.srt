00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
Welcome to an Overview of Cloud Security on AWS.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,190
In this lesson,

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,320
you will learn about the benefits of using AWS's secure infrastructure

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,420
and services.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,320
With AWS, you will gain the control and confidence you need to securely run

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,060
your business with the most flexible and

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,950
secure cloud computing environment available today.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,170
AWS customers benefit from AWS data centers and

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,770
a network architecture to protect your information, identities,

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,000
applications, and devices.

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,380
Automating security tasks on AWS

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,870
enables you to be more secure by reducing human configuration areas,

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,990
giving your team more time to focus on innovation and scaling.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,090
Select from a wide variety of deeply integrated

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,050
solutions that can be combined to automate tasks,

16
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,820
making it easier for your security team to work closely

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,640
with developer and operations teams to create and deploy code faster

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,750
and more securely.

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,510
AWS is vigilant about your privacy.

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,900
All data flowing across the AWS global network

21
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,000
is encrypted at the physical layer before it leaves our secure facilities.

22
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,060
And additional encryption layers exist,

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,390
such as with VPC cross-Region peering traffic and service-to-service TLS connections.

24
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,620
AWS also features fine-grain identity and access controls that

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,310
ensure the right resources have the correct access at all times.

26
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,540
For compliance,

27
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,880
AWS regularly achieves third-party validation

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,350
for thousands of global compliance requirements

29
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,760
to help you meet security and compliance standards for finance,

30
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,720
retail, healthcare, and more.

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,130
AWS is also the only commercial cloud that has

32
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,340
had its service offerings and associated supply chain vetted

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,320
and accepted

34
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,740
as secure enough for top-secret workloads.

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,420
You can extend the benefits of AWS

36
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,060
by using security technology and consulting services from

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,720
familiar solution providers within the AWS Partner Network.

38
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,820
AWS security services help you define user permissions and identities,

39
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,180
infrastructure protection,

40
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,930
and data protection measures

41
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,210
for a smooth and planned

42
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,970
AWS adoption strategy.

43
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,970
You can also gain visibility into your organization's security posture

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,040
with logging and monitoring services,

45
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,920
then ingest this information into a scalable platform

46
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,130
for event management,

47
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,880
testing,

48
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,830
and auditing.

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,780
AWS enables you to automate incident response and recovery

50
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,400
to help shift the primary focus of security teams from response

51
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,060
to analyzing root cause.

52
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,690
With AWS,

53
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,100
you can utilize event-driven automation to quickly remediate

54
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,360
and secure your AWS environment in near real-time.
