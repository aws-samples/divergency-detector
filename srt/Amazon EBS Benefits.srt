00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,010
EBS volumes are performant for your most demanding

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,810
workloads, including mission-critical applications such as SAP,

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,360
Oracle, and Microsoft products.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,250
Relational and non-relational databases,

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,360
enterprise applications, containerized applications,

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,040
big data analytics engines,

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,990
file systems, and media workflows are also widely deployed on Amazon EBS.

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,650
You can choose from different volume types

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,760
to balance optimal price and performance.

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,800
Highly available and durable. Designed for mission-critical systems,

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,760
EBS volumes are automatically replicated within an

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,450
Availability Zone, or AZ, and offer 99.999% availability.

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,660
EBS offers a high-durability volume io2

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,290
for customers that need 99.999% durability,

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,890
especially for their business-critical applications.

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,340
Since EBS volumes are for persistent data, it is important to back up the data.

19
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,170
EBS Snapshot with Amazon Lifecycle Manager, or DLM,

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,760
provides a simple and robust backup

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,870
solution to protect your data and can be used to enable disaster recovery.

22
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,250
Cost-effective. EBS offers different volumes

23
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,990
at various price points and performance benchmarks. Options

24
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,360
range from highly cost-effective dollar-per-gigabyte

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,840
volumes to high-performance volumes with high IOPS

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,950
and high throughput designed for mission-critical workloads.

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,560
This enables you to optimize costs and invest in

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,290
a precise level of storage for your application needs.

29
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,180
Additionally, Amazon EBS snapshots are stored incrementally,

30
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,360
which means you are billed only for the changed blocks stored and save storage cost.

31
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:51,230
Easy to use. Amazon EBS volumes are easy to create, use, encrypt, and protect.

32
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,190
Elastic volumes is a feature that allows you to easily adapt

33
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,390
your storage volumes as the needs of your applications change.

34
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,190
You can also easily create backups of your volume using EBS Snapshot,

35
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,990
and easily automate snapshot management using Data Lifecycle Manager, or DLM,

36
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,840
without any additional overhead or cost.

37
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,770
Virtually unlimited scale.

38
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,250
You can build applications that require as little as a single

39
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,440
gigabyte of storage or scale up to petabytes of data -

40
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,130
all in just a few clicks.

41
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,070
Snapshots can be used to quickly restore new

42
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,980
volumes, enabling rapid scale. Secure. Access to Amazon EBS volumes

43
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,210
is integrated with AWS Identity and Access Management, or AWS IAM,

44
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,000
which enables access control to your Amazon EBS volumes.

45
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,570
EBS is built to be secure for data compliance.

46
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,870
Newly created EBS volumes can be encrypted by

47
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,310
default with a single setting in your account.

48
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,330
EBS volumes support encryption of data at rest,

49
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,710
data in transit, and all volume backups.

50
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,890
EBS encryption is supported by all volume types,

51
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,320
includes built-in key management infrastructure,

52
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,250
and has zero impact on performance.
