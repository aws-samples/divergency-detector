1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:02,293
This is the practice section.

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,921
Use it
to build the first part of the solution

3
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:10,301
using the AWS Console and image
based instructions. To begin building,

4
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:16,141
allow browser popups, then launch the AWS
Console in a separate browser tab.

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,686
Follow the steps to complete part
one of the solution,

6
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:22,897
then move to the do it yourself section.

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,944
One more important
note. The AWS Console environment

8
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:31,614
starts up and shuts down
automatically with a temporary account.

9
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:36,286
You should never use your personal AWS
account in the solution center.
