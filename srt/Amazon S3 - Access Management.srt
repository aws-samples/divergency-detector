1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Access Management.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,760
By default,

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:10,140
all Amazon S3 resources, such as buckets and objects, are private.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,940
Only the resource owner,

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,390
an AWS account that created it, can access the resource.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,370
The resource owner can optionally grant access

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,210
permissions to others by writing an access policy.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,060
Amazon S3 offers access policy options that can be

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,120
broadly categorized as resource-based policies and user policies.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,980
Resource-based policies are access policies that you attach

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,560
to your resources such as buckets and objects.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,610
Bucket policies and access control lists, or ACLs,

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,320
are resource-based policies.

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,650
You can also authenticate certain types of data access using

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,170
query-string authentication to grant temporary access to others

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,770
with time-limited URLs.

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,520
User policies are access policies that you attach to users.

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,360
Access can be granted to users using AWS IAM policies.

19
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,790
You may choose to use resource-based policies,

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,400
user policies, or some combination of these to manage permissions

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,120
to your Amazon S3 resources.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,280
Access Control List is a legacy access control mechanism.

23
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,760
As a general rule,

24
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,080
AWS recommends using S3 bucket policies or IAM policies for access control.

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,930
When Amazon S3 receives a request,

26
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,690
it must evaluate all the access policies to

27
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,470
determine whether to authorize or deny the request.

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,500
First, let's look at resource-based policies.

29
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,990
Access control lists.

30
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,820
Each bucket and object has an access control list,

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,980
an ACL associated with it.

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,260
Access control lists use Amazon S3-specific XML schema.

33
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,280
It defines which AWS accounts or groups

34
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,780
are granted access and the type of access they have.

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,850
When you create a bucket or an object, Amazon S3 creates a default ACL

36
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,160
that grants the resource owner full control over the resource.

37
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,710
You can use access control lists to grant

38
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,480
basic read/write permissions to other AWS accounts.

39
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,160
A Bucket policy, written in JSON, is attached to an S3 bucket.

40
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:12,380
It provides access permissions to the S3 bucket and all objects in it.

41
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,570
Here is an example of an S3 bucket policy.

42
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,850
This S3 bucket policy allows the principal,

43
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,930
the root account, and the IAM user Alice

44
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,940
under that account to perform any S3 operation.

45
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,840
The wildcard asterisk character after the S3 in the action statement

46
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,780
indicates that all S3 operations are allowed.

47
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,930
Particularly, you can perform S3 operations

48
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,170
only on specific resources as shown in

49
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,060
the resource statement.

50
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,260
In this case, only the S3 bucket with name

51
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,740
my_bucket and all objects in it are allowed.

52
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,990
As you can see, you can use the slash and asterisk

53
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,950
after the bucket name to indicate all objects in the bucket.

54
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:54,500
User policies control who has access to your Amazon S3 resources

55
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,040
and is written in JSON.

56
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,360
You can use AWS Identity and Access Management, or AWS IAM,

57
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,660
to create users, groups, and roles in your account

58
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,400
and attach access policies to grant them access to Amazon S3.

59
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,600
Let's look at an IAM policy example.

60
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,400
Unlike bucket policies,

61
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,800
IAM policy does not require a principal

62
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,070
element because the principal is, by default,

63
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,370
the entity that the IAM policy is attached to.

64
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,220
The first part of the policy specifies bucket-level permissions.

65
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,030
It allows the ListBucket action so that applications

66
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,950
can list all objects in the test bucket.

67
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,970
The second part specifies object-level permissions.

68
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,470
It allows PutObject,

69
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,340
GetObject, and DeleteObject actions so that applications can write,

70
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,230
read, and delete any objects in the test bucket.
