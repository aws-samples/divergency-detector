00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) - Features

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,920
Availability and Durability.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,180
Amazon RDS also offers features to enhance availability

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,110
and durability for your production workloads. Turned on by default,

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,710
the automated backup feature of Amazon RDS

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,390
will back up your databases and transaction logs,

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,290
and saves them securely in Amazon S3 for a user-specified retention period.

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,100
Your automatic backup retention period can be configured to up to 35 days.

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,660
Automated backups enables point-in-time recovery for your database instance.

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,030
It allows you to restore your database instance to any second

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,900
during your retention period, up to the last five minutes.

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,920
Database snapshots are user-initiated backups of your instance

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,490
stored in Amazon S3 that are kept until you explicitly delete them.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,820
You can create a new instance from a database snapshot whenever you desire.

15
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,590
Although database snapshots serve operationally as full backups,

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,970
you're billed only for incremental storage use.

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,099
Amazon RDS will automatically replace the compute instance

18
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,610
power in your deployment in the event of a hardware failure.

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,360
Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,150
provide enhanced availability and durability for database instances,

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,140
making them a natural fit for production database workloads.

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,670
When you provision a Multi-AZ DB instance,

23
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,210
Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB instance

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,680
and synchronously replicates the data to a standby DB instance

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,360
in a different Availability Zone

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,150
in the same or different Region.

27
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,910
In case of an infrastructure failure,

28
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,500
Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby.

29
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,800
The standby DB instance is promoted to become the primary DB instance.

30
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,090
Data is replicated back to a new standby DB instance

31
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,460
to retain high availability. Since the end point for your DB instance

32
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,430
remains the same after a failover,

33
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,160
your application can resume database operations

34
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,940
as soon as the failover is complete.

35
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,210
No manual administrative intervention is needed.
