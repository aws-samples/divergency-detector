00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,660
Welcome to an Overview

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,910
of the Types of Cloud Computing Models.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,600
There are three main cloud computing models.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,670
First, let's look at Infrastructure as a Service.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,990
Infrastructure as a Service contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,210
and typically provides access to data storage space,

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,250
compute services, virtual or dedicated hardware, and networking features.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,380
It offers you the most control over IT resources, trading off convenience

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,510
instead of building it all by yourself.

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,920
You can also simplify provisioning and

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,570
management by modeling your cloud infrastructure with

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,700
a simple text file or programming languages and use as a template.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,650
Our resources needed

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,880
for your applications can then be provisioned

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,230
and configured based on your template automatically.

16
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,740
This offers convenience to build your cloud environment.

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,950
Platform as a Service.

18
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,940
Platform as a Service removes the need for

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,050
organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure platform

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,870
and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications.

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,260
This helps you be more efficient

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,960
as you don't need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning,

23
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,140
software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated

24
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,580
heavy lifting involved in running your application.

25
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,340
Here are some examples.

26
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,880
To deploy your application, all you need to do is to upload your application code.

27
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,060
Your application will be ready to use within minutes.

28
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,360
In this example,

29
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,210
you can still retain control over the resources powering your application

30
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,670
and can access the underlying resources.

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,950
You can also run containers without having to manage servers or clusters.

32
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,170
All you have to do is package your application code and runtime into a container,

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,760
and then simply deploy your container to the cloud underlying platform.

34
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,590
Provisioning and management will be handled for you.

35
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,750
In addition, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers.

36
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,340
All you need to do is to upload your code or function.

37
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,280
In this case, you do not have control of the underlying infrastructure.

38
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,530
The service provides you the convenience of taking care of

39
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,070
everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.

40
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,190
Software as a Service.

41
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,950
Software as a Service offers you end-user applications.

42
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,820
You do not have to think about how the service

43
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,330
is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed.

44
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,180
All the heavy-lifting work is done for you behind the scenes.

45
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,880
A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email,

46
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,050
where you can send and receive email without

47
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,760
having to manage feature additions to the email product

48
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,430
or maintaining the servers and operating systems

49
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,250
that the email program is running on.

50
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,260
Here is a comparison between the level of control and convenience

51
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,730
within the three cloud computing models.

52
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,790
Software as a Service provides you with the highest level of convenience

53
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,490
as you are just using the end-user applications.

54
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,150
As you move from Infrastructure as a Service to Software

55
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,180
as a Service, your level of convenience increases.

56
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,980
Infrastructure as a Service

57
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,080
provides you the most control of your IT resources.

58
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,340
As you move from Software as a Service to Infrastructure as a Service,

59
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,390
your level of control increases.
