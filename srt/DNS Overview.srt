00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,810
Welcome to an overview of DNS, or Domain Name System.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,480
Computers on the internet communicate with one another

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,120
by using numbers known as IP addresses.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,830
When you visit a website,

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,850
you don't have to remember a long number.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,280
Instead, you can enter a domain name like www.example.com

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,940
that is easier to remember.

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,850
A DNS service such as Amazon Route 53

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,930
is a globally distributed service

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,580
that translates human-readable names like www.example.com

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,000
into numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,240
that computers use to connect to each other.

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,240
The internet's DNS (system) works much like a phone book

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,830
by managing the mapping between names and numbers.

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,070
DNS servers translate requests for names into IP addresses,

16
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,790
controlling which server an end user will reach

17
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,950
when they type a domain name into their web browser.

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,300
These requests are called queries.

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,410
Let's take a look at how DNS queries work.

20
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,959
First, the host sends a DNS request to the local DNS server.

21
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,350
Second, the DNS server,

22
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,480
which is preconfigured with the list of root name servers, randomly selects one

23
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,130
root name server for the "A" record www.example.com.

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,460
An "A" record maps a domain name

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,330
like example.com to an IP address

26
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,390
of the computer that hosts the domain.

27
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,040
Third, the root name server responds

28
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,250
with a list of authoritative name servers for the .com zone,

29
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,580
along with a list of the IP addresses.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,850
Fourth, the DNS server randomly selects one of the authoritative name

31
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,550
servers returned in step three

32
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,300
and sends another DNS query for the "A" record

33
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,480
example.com to the top-level domain server.

34
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,350
Fifth, the top-level domain name server

35
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,410
responds with a list of name servers

36
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,510
that are authoritative for the domain example.com.

37
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,220
Sixth, the DNS server

38
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,340
randomly selects one of the authoritative name servers returned in step five

39
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,550
and sends another DNS query for the "A" record example.com.

40
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,970
Seventh, since the name server receiving the query in step six

41
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,630
is authoritative for the domain example.com,

42
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,630
the name server responds to the DNS server with the IP address value

43
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,900
of the "A" record for example.com.

44
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,920
And for the final step, the DNS server

45
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,400
sends the DNS response with the IP address back to the host,

46
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,210
which enables the host computer to connect to www.example.com.
