00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,670
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) Overview.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,570
Amazon EFS provides a simple, scalable,

3
00:00:05,575 --> 00:00:09,170
fully managed elastic network file system, or NFS,

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:14,870
for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,850
The service manages all the file-storage infrastructure for you,

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,420
meaning that you can avoid the complexity of deploying,

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,240
patching, and maintaining complex file-system configurations.

8
00:00:24,242 --> 00:00:30,220
Amazon EFS supports the network file system version 4 protocol,

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,050
NFS version 4.1, and NFS version 4.0.

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,580
So the applications and tools that you use today

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,640
work seamlessly with Amazon EFS.

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,310
Amazon EFS is highly scalable.

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,790
It is built to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications,

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,225
growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files.

15
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,425
Amazon EFS is designed to provide massively parallel shared access

16
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:55,547
to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances,

17
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:59,270
where they can access the data and EFS at the same time.

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,100
This enables your applications to achieve high levels of aggregate throughput

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,400
and IOPS with consistent low latencies.

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,199
Amazon EFS is a regional service

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,150
that is designed to be highly available and highly durable.

22
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:18,050
It stores data within and across multiple Availability Zones, or AZs.

23
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,670
Amazon EC2 instances can access your file system across AZs,

24
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,900
Regions, and VPCs, while on-premises servers

25
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,280
can access using AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN.

26
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,930
Amazon EFS is well-suited to support a broad spectrum of use cases,

27
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,200
from home directories to business-critical applications.

28
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,200
Customers can use EFS to lift and

29
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:43,260
shift existing enterprise applications to the AWS Cloud.

30
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,750
Other use cases include web serving and content management, big-data analytics,

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,530
application development and testing, media and entertainment workflows,

32
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,500
database backups, and container storage.

33
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,630
Amazon EFS is designed for Linux-based applications.

34
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,430
In addition, Amazon FSx provides you with two file systems from which to choose:

35
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:11,030
Amazon FSx for Windows File Server for Windows-based applications

36
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,040
and Amazon FSx for Lustre for compute-intensive workloads.
