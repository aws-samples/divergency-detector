00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,670
Amazon Aurora Serverless Overview.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,710
Unpredictable workloads are challenging.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,380
Manually managing database capacity can take up valuable time

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,070
and can lead to inefficient use of database resources.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,370
If you overprovision, you pay for unused resources.

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,850
If you underprovision, you risk a bad user experience.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,200
Amazon Aurora Serverless is an on-demand autoscaling configuration for

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,510
Amazon Aurora, MySQL-compatible and

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,010
PostgresSQL-compatible relational database.

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,090
It is ideal for infrequent, intermittent, or unpredictable workloads.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,900
Why Aurora Serverless? Here are the key benefits.

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,110
First, it is simple. It is a serverless database.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,720
You do not need to manage any database instances and capacity.

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,510
The database will automatically start up, shut down,

15
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,830
and scale capacity up or down based on your application's needs.

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,910
Aurora Serverless is scalable.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,770
Compute and memory capacity can seamlessly scale as

18
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,650
needed with no disruption to client connections.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,840
Cost-effective.

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,780
You pay only for the database resources you consume on a per-second basis,

21
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,840
while instance is active. You don't pay for the database

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,550
instance when it is not running.

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,250
Highly available. Amazon Aurora Serverless is

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,940
built on distributed fault-tolerant, self-healing

25
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,030
Aurora storage with six-way replication to protect against data loss.

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,670
Data blocks and disks are continuously

27
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,100
scanned for errors and repaired automatically.

28
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,700
Your database volume is replicated six ways across three Availability Zones.

29
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,720
What are the common use cases? Infrequently used applications.

30
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,840
You have an application that is only used for

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,290
a few minutes several times per day or week,

32
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,510
such as a low-volume blog site. With Aurora Serverless,

33
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,470
you only pay for the database resources you consume.

34
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,960
New applications.

35
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,090
You are deploying a new application and are unsure which instance size you need.

36
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,650
Unpredictable workloads.

37
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,080
You're running workloads where there is database usage throughout the day

38
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,530
and also peaks of activity that are hard to predict,

39
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,800
for example, a traffic site that might see a surge of activity when it starts raining.

40
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,640
Development and test databases.

41
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,760
Your software development and QA teams are using databases during work hours

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,910
but don't need them on nights or weekends.

43
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,120
With Aurora Serverless,

44
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,480
your database automatically shuts down when not in use and starts

45
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,120
up much more quickly when work starts the next day.

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,440
Multitenant applications.

47
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,650
You have a web-based application with a database for each of

48
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,550
your customers. Aurora manages individual database capacity for you,

49
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,250
saving you valuable time.
