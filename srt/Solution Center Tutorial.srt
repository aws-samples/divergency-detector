1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,466
Welcome to the Solution Center.

2
00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:07,100
Here you will learn about AWS services
and receive guidance

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,500
on how to build AWS solutions for common
use cases.

4
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:14,133
The Solution Center has four sections

5
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:19,666
Learn, plan, practice
and do it yourself. DIY.

6
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:24,733
Use the learn section to study the
architecture and watch AWS service videos.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,333
The plan section provides
an overview of the building tasks.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,333
Use the practice section
to build the first part of the solution

9
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:35,433
using the AWS
console and image based instructions.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,033
To begin
building allow pop-ups, then launch

11
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:41,033
the AWS console in a separate browser tab.

12
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:43,633
Follow the steps to complete part
one of the solution,

13
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:46,166
then move to the do it yourself section.

14
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,633
In the do it yourself section.

15
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:50,966
You must build part
two of your solution, then validate it.

16
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:54,466
Read the hints on the left panel,
then build part two of your solution

17
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:57,833
using the same AWS console environment.

18
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,633
Use the validation
field to confirm functionality.

19
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:04,466
If your solution is valid,
you can move on to the next task.

20
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:08,266
One more important
note. The AWS console environment

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,300
starts up and shuts down
automatically with a temporary account.

22
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:16,733
You should never use your personal AWS
account in the solution center.

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,300
That's all for now.

24
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,033
Good luck with your search for Cloudia.
