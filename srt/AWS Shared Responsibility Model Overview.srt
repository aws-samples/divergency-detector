00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Welcome to a brief lesson

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,690
on the AWS Shared Responsibility Model.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,400
The AWS Shared Responsibility Model details the division of responsibilities

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,950
between AWS and customers.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,740
This differentiation is commonly referred to as

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,200
security in the cloud, which is the customer's responsibility,

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,740
versus security of the cloud, which is AWS's responsibility.

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,760
Security and compliance is a shared responsibility

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,210
between AWS and the customer.

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,650
This shared model

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,400
can help relieve the customer's operational burden

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,050
as AWS operates,

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,050
manages, and controls

14
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,600
the host operating system

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,100
and virtualization layer,

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,630
down to the physical security of the facilities

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,360
in which the service operates.

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,280
AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure

19
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,790
that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud.

20
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,630
This infrastructure is composed of the hardware,

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,340
software, networking,

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,510
and facilities

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,880
that run AWS Cloud services.

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,800
For customers, they assume responsibility

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,490
and management of the guest operating system,

26
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,660
including updates and security patches,

27
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,940
other associated application software,

28
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,820
and configuration of the AWS-provided security group firewall.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,320
Customers should carefully consider the services

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,840
they choose as their responsibilities vary.

31
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,050
Depending on the services used,

32
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,230
the integration of those services into their IT environment,

33
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,390
and applicable laws and regulations,

34
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,370
customers are also responsible for managing their data,

35
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,580
including encryption options, classifying their assets,

36
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,710
and using IAM tools to apply the appropriate permissions.

37
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,900
Let's take a look at how responsibilities

38
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,060
change depending on the AWS services selected.

39
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:53,930
Amazon EC2 is categorized as infrastructure as a service, or IaaS,

40
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,960
and as such

41
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,150
requires the customer to perform all of the necessary security configuration

42
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,610
and management tasks.

43
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,420
When working with EC2 instances,

44
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,110
customers are responsible for resources in the cloud,

45
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,800
which includes customer data,

46
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,360
the guest operating system

47
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,860
including updates and security patches, application software,

48
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,030
IAM policies,

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,240
networking and firewall configuration,

50
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,650
client-side encryption,

51
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,020
server-side encryption,

52
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,700
and network-traffic encryption.

53
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,900
AWS is responsible for security of the cloud,

54
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,060
which involves protecting the infrastructure that runs EC2 instances.

55
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,340
This is composed of virtualization software for compute,

56
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,420
storage, database, and networking services,

57
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,440
the underlying hardware within each data center that

58
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,090
comprises the AWS Global Infrastructure,

59
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,750
and the physical infrastructure that supports

60
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,840
AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and edge locations.

61
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,370
With AWS Lambda,

62
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,200
the responsibilities change

63
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,880
as customers must manage the security of their code

64
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,560
and identity and access management to the Lambda service

65
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,340
as well as within their functions.

66
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,640
More specifically,

67
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,560
customers are responsible for managing customer function code libraries,

68
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,260
resource configurations,

69
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,230
and identity and access management

70
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,560
for Lambda functions.

71
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,630
When using AWS Lambda,

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,240
AWS is responsible for managing the underlying infrastructure

73
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,030
that includes the compute and execution environments,

74
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,790
the Lambda runtime language,

75
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,230
networking infrastructure,

76
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,420
the service software,

77
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,680
underlying hardware,

78
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,950
and the facilities that support the Regions,

79
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,440
Availability Zones,

80
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,860
and EC2 hardware.
