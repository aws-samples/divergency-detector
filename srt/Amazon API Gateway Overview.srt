Amazon API Gateway Overview

2
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:12,541
Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed
service that developers can use to publish, maintain, monitor, secure, and operate APIs at any scale.

3
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:19,958
API Gateway is a pay-as-you-go service
that removes the heavy lifting involved in securely and reliably running APIs at scale.

4
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:27,583
APIs act as the front door for
applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services.

5
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:35,625
Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful
APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time, two-way communication applications.

6
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,416
Key Features

7
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:41,666
Support for RESTful APIs and WebSocket
APIs

8
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:50,791
With API Gateway, you can create RESTful
APIs by using either HTTP APIs or REpresentational State Transfer, or REST APIs.

9
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:56,916
HTTP APIs are the best way to build APIs
that do not require API management features.

10
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,250
They are optimized for serverless
workloads and HTTP backends.

11
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:07,791
REST APIs are used for workloads that
require API proxy functionality and API management features.

12
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:15,166
WebSocket APIs are used to build
real-time, two-way communication applications, such as chat apps and streaming dashboards.

13
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,500
Resiliency

14
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:25,333
You can use API Gateway to set throttling
rules based on the number of requests per second for each HTTP method in your APIs.

15
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:37,583
This helps you manage traffic to your
backend systems. API Gateway handles any level of traffic received by an API, so you are free to focus on your business logic and services rather than maintaining infrastructure.

16
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,208
AWS authorization

17
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:50,208
To authorize and verify API requests to
AWS services, API Gateway can help you leverage signature version 4 for REST APIs and WebSocket APIs.

18
00:01:50,500 --> 00:02:02,000
Using signature version 4 authentication,
you can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and access policies to authorize access to your APIs and all your other AWS resources.

19
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,666
Benefits

20
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,458
Performance at any scale

21
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:16,583
Provide end users with the lowest possible
latency for API requests and responses by taking advantage of the AWS global network of edge locations using Amazon CloudFront.

22
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,208
Streamlined monitoring

23
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:31,083
Monitor performance metrics and
information on API calls, data latency, and error rates from the API Gateway dashboard, which allows you to visually monitor calls to your services using Amazon CloudWatch.

24
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,541
Efficient API development

25
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:41,791
Run multiple versions of the same API
simultaneously, allowing you to quickly iterate, test, and release new versions.

26
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:47,625
Applications can continue to call previous
API versions even after the latest versions are published.

27
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:55,416
API Gateway also helps you manage multiple
release stages for each API version, such as alpha, beta, and production.
