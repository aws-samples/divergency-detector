Amazon DynamoDB Overview

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:07,000
Amazon DynamoDB is a key value and
document database.

3
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:10,666
It delivers single-digit millisecond
performance at any scale.

4
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:20,291
It's a fully managed, multi-region,
multi-active, durable database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications.

5
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:27,041
DynamoDB can handle more than 10 trillion
requests per day and can support peaks of more than 20 million requests per second.

6
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,833
Here are the key benefits.

7
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,333
Performance at scale.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,125
DynamoDB is a key-value and document
database that can support tables of virtually any size with horizontal scaling.

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:46,625
Since DynamoDB is both a key value and
document data models, it enables flexible schema, which allows you to adapt to your business requirement change easily.

10
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:56,500
For use cases that require even faster
access with microsecond latency, DynamoDB Accelerator, or DAX provides a fully managed-in-memory cache.

11
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:01,833
Using DAX, you can improve the read
performance of your DynamoDB tables by up to 10 times.

12
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:08,083
The time required for reads reduces from
milliseconds to microseconds, even at millions of requests per second.

13
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:18,750
DynamoDB Global Tables replicate your data
across multiple AWS regions to give you fast, local access to data for your globally distributed applications.

14
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:28,541
DynamoDB Streams capture a time-ordered
sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB table and store this information in a log for up to 24 hours.

15
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:33,208
DynamoDB provides both provisioned and
on-demand capacity modes.

16
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:37,791
Tables using Provisioned Capacity mode
require you to set Read and Write Capacity.

17
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:45,333
For workloads that are less predictable,
On-Demand Capacity Mode takes care of managing capacity for you, and you only pay for what you consume.

18
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:52,875
With the two capacity modes, you can
optimize costs by specifying capacity per workload, or paying for only the resources you consume.

19
00:01:53,125 --> 00:02:01,541
For tables using on-demand capacity mode,
DynamoDB instantly accommodates your workloads as they ramp up or down to any previously reached traffic level.

20
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:07,500
For tables using provisioned capacity,
DynamoDB delivers automatic scaling of throughput and storage.

21
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:19,083
If your application traffic grows,
DynamoDB increases throughput to accommodate the load. If your application traffic shrinks, DynamoDB scales down, so that you pay less for unused capacity.

22
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:23,083
DynamoDB integrates with AWS Lambda to
provide triggers.

23
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:28,708
With Triggers, you can build applications
that react to data modifications in DynamoDB tables.

24
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:35,166
The Lambda function can perform any
actions you specify, such as sending a notification or initiating a workflow.

25
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,916
Encryption at rest.

26
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,708
DynamoDB encrypts all data by default.

27
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:46,375
Encryption at rest enhances the security
of your data by using encryption keys stored in AWS Key Management Service.

28
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,041
ACID Transactions

29
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:58,125
It provides native server-side support for
transactions, simplifying the developer experience of making coordinated, all-or-nothing changes to multiple items both within and across tables.

30
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:05,208
Point-In-Time Recovery, or PITR, helps
protect your DynamoDB tables from accidental write or delete operations.

31
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:09,666
PITR provides continuous backups of your
DynamoDB table data.

32
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:15,333
You can recover to any point in time up to
the second, during the preceding 35 days with no downtime.

33
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,041
On Demand Backup and Restore

34
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:23,833
You can create full backups of hundreds of
terabytes of data instantly with no performance impact to your tables.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,541
The archived data can help you meet your
corporate and governmental regulatory requirements.

36
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:33,333
DynamoDB is also backed by a service level
agreement for guaranteed availability.
