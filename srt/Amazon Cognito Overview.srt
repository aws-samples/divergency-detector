Amazon Cognito Overview.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,720
Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up,

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,820
sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,360
The two main components of Amazon Cognito are user pools and identity pools.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,710
User pools are user directories that provide sign-up

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,240
and sign-in service options for your app users.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,110
User pools provide user profiles

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,130
and authentication tokens for users.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,480
Identity pools enable you to grant your users access to other AWS services.

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,830
You can use identity pools

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,790
and user pools separately or together.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,990

As a fully managed service,

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,540
user pools are easy to set up without any worries about server infrastructure.

identity providers, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter Digits.

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,760
Cognito also works with external identity providers that support OpenID Connect

23
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,770
and enterprise identity providers such as Microsoft Active Directory via SAML.

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,660
You can also use your own identity provider

25
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,060
as custom integration.

You can define roles and map users to different roles,

42
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,540
so your app can access only the resources that are authorized for each user.

Adaptive authentication.

52
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,340
When Amazon Cognito detects unusual sign-in activity, such

53
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,990
as sign-in attempts from new locations and devices,

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,360
it assigns a risk score for the activity.

55
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,260
It then lets you choose to either prompt users

56
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,570
for additional verification or block the sign-in request.

57
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,050

00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,850
When Amazon Cognito detects users have entered

61
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,180
credentials that have been compromised elsewhere,

62
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,330
it prompts users to change their password.

63
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,040
Let's look at how Amazon Cognito user pool

64
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,020
and identity pool are used in this authentication example.

65
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,870
When your users sign into your web or mobile application directly,

66
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,830
you send an authentication request to

67
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,430
Amazon Cognito user pool for authentication.

68
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,620
Your users can also sign in through third-party identity providers.

69
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,500
Federation is available in Amazon Cognito user pool.

70
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,380
Amazon Cognito handles the tokens that are returned from the identity providers,

71
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,310
whether your users sign in directly or through a third party.

72
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,840
After successfully authenticating, Amazon Cognito user pool issues

73
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,270
one standard set of Cognito user pool tokens,

74
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,460
which is a set of JSON web tokens, or JWT.

75
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,680
You can use the Cognito user pool tokens in your application.

76
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,160
You can also use the Cognito user pool tokens to control who can access your API

77
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,019
and Amazon API Gateway.

78
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,350
API Gateway validates the tokens and uses them to grant your users access to

79
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,640
backend resources such as the serverless backend with the AWS Lambda.

80
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,940
Or if you need to get AWS credentials,

81
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,090
Amazon Cognito identity pool provides temporary AWS credentials

82
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,560
to grant your users access to other AWS services directly.

83
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,150
With Amazon Cognito,

84
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,640
you can spend your time creating great applications

85
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,620
and let Amazon Cognito handle authentication for you.
