00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,400
Amazon EventBridge Overview.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,530
Amazon EventBridge is a serverless,

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,420
fully managed, and scalable event bus

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,040
that you can use to connect your applications

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,630
with data from a variety of sources,

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,079
such as an AWS environment,

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,600
a SaaS partner service, or one of your applications or services.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,540
Events are represented as JSON objects,

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,080
and they all have a similar structure and the same top-level fields.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,170
An event indicates a change in an environment. When EventBridge receives an event,

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,840
it applies a rule to rig the event to a target.

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,440
Rules are based either on an event pattern or a schedule.

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,000
An event pattern defines the event structure in the fields that a rule matches.

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,050
A target is a resource or endpoint that EventBridge sends an event to,

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,770
such as a function in AWS Lambda,

16
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,980
a task in Amazon Elastic Container Service,

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,560
or a topic in Amazon Simple Notification Service.

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,060
You can use

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,730
AWS Identity and Access Management to control access to EventBridge.

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,850
Amazon EventBridge is directly integrated with

21
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,490
AWS services as event sources or targets.

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,480
EventBridge also supports integration

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,300
with SaaS applications from many providers.

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,190
Amazon EventBridge Benefits.

25
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,350
Reliable event delivery.

26
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,810
Amazon EventBridge provides at least one event delivery to targets,

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,630
including retry with exponential backoff for up to 24 hours.

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,690
Events are stored durably across multiple Availability Zones,

29
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,100
providing additional assurance that your events

30
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,880
will be delivered to their destination.

31
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,900
Build event-driven applications at scale.

32
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:49,120
An event-driven architecture uses events to invoke and communicate

33
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,950
between decoupled services. By decoupling

34
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,460
your applications into multiple services,

35
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,210
each component operates independently.

36
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,460
EventBridge acts like a connector,

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,070
sending data across components.

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,170
Using this architecture,

39
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,710
you can build and innovate faster

40
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,160
while increasing the resiliency

41
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,600
and scalability of your application.

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,350
This is the end of Amazon EventBridge overview.

43
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,850
Thanks for watching.
