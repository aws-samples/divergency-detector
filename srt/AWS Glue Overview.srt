00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,940
AWS Glue Overview.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,920
AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,830
that can be used to discover, prepare,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,840
and combine data for analytics,

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:11,890
machine learning,

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,530
and application development.

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,670
AWS Glue provides all the capabilities needed for

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,680
data integration, so that you can start

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,240
analyzing your data and putting it to use in minutes instead of months.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,080
AWS Glue provides both visual

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,330
and code-based interfaces for data integration.

12
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,680
Users can find and access data

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,220
by using the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,690
Data engineers can extract, transform,

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,640
and load, or ETL.

16
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,970
Developers can visually create, run,

17
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,310
and monitor ETL workflows with a few clicks in AWS Glue Studio.

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,520
Data analysts and data scientists can use

19
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,680
AWS Glue DataBrew to visually enrich, clean,

20
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,880
and normalize data without writing code.

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,260
With AWS Glue Elastic Views,

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,500
application developers can use familiar

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,750
structured query language, or SQL,

24
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,019
to combine and replicate data across different datastores.

25
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,560
AWS Glue benefits. Faster data integration.

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,380
Different groups across your organization can use

27
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,840
AWS Glue to work together on data integration tasks,

28
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,450
including extraction, cleaning, normalization,

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,060
combining, loading,

30
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,460
and running scalable ETL workflows.

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,070
Automate your data integration at scale.

32
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,480
AWS Glue automates much of the effort required for data integration.

33
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,040
AWS Glue crawls your data sources,

34
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,720
identifies data formats,

35
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,260
and suggests schemas to store your data.

36
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,560
It automatically generates the code

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,330
to run your data transformations

38
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,740
and loading processes.

39
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,120
No servers to manage.

40
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,360
There is no infrastructure to manage,

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,280
and AWS Glue provisions, configures,

42
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,200
and scales the resources required

43
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,180
to run your data integration jobs.

44
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,690
You pay only for the resources your jobs use while running.
