AWS Key Management Service Overview.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:09,050
AWS Key Management Service, or AWS KMS, is a managed service that makes it easy

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,610
for you to create and manage keys and control the

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,870
use of encryption across a wide range of AWS services.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,650
KMS is a secure and resilient service

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,110
that uses FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,540
modules to isolate and protect your keys.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,880
You can generate keys in AWS KMS or

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,430
import them from your own key management infrastructure.

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,970
You can submit data directly to AWS KMS to be encrypted or decrypted,

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,510
and other AWS services can use your keys

12
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,840
on your behalf to protect data encryption keys.

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,850
Your keys never leave AWS KMS, and you are always in control of your keys.

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,550
You can set usage policies that determine which

15
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,650
users can use your keys and what actions they can perform.

16
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:53,660
And all requests are logged in AWS CloudTrail so you can track usage.

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,690
Here are some benefits from using the AWS Key Management Service.

18
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,500
With AWS Key Management Service,

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,390
you can focus on your use of encryption while AWS handles durability,

20
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,680
physical security, and policy enforcement to ensure that

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,080
your keys are always available and safe.

22
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,700
KMS presents a single control point to manage keys and define

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,570
policies consistently across integrated AWS services and your own applications.

24
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,710
AWS KMS is integrated with the AWS Encryption SDK to enable you to use

25
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,740
KMS-protected data encryption keys to encrypt locally within

26
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,240
your applications. Using APIs,

27
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,370
you can build encryption and key management

28
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,570
into your own applications wherever they run.

29
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,230
You can also perform digital signing operations using asymmetric

30
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,050
key pairs to ensure the integrity of your data.

31
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,500
Recipients of digitally signed data can verify the signatures

32
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,840
whether they have an AWS account or not.

33
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,660
AWS KMS uses hardware security modules that have been validated under

34
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,490
FIPS 140-2 to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your keys.

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,260
This means that your plaintext keys are never written to

36
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,570
disk and only ever used in volatile memory of the HSMs

37
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,130
for the time needed to perform your requested cryptographic operation.

38
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:15,020
AWS KMS is designed so only you can retrieve your plaintext keys from the service.

39
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,800
Your keys are only used inside these devices and can never leave them unencrypted,

40
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,940
and KMS keys are never shared outside the AWS Region in which they were created.

41
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,060
AWS KMS's security and quality controls

42
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,300
have been validated by numerous compliance

43
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,590
regimes such as PCI DSS,

44
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,760
FIPS, HIPAA, and FedRAMP.

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,420
AWS KMS also provides the option to store your keys in single-tenant HSMs

46
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:48,220
in AWS Cloud HSM instances that you control. For auditing, AWS KMS

47
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,740
is integrated with AWS CloudTrail to record all API requests,

48
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,630
including key management actions and usage of your keys.

49
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,440
With CloudTrail enabled,

50
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,070
each request you make to AWS KMS is recorded in a log

51
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,930
file that is delivered to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify.
