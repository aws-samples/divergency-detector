00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,520
Supervised Learning.

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,860
Supervised learning

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,670
is a type of machine learning algorithm which learns from historical labeled data

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,500
and predicts future outcomes.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,200
The input training data set

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,440
includes both the input values,

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,750
also referred as features and the known output values,

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,800
which are labels with the correct answers.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,820
In this example,

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,360
the algorithm is given a set of training data with images of dogs,

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,880
where the data is correctly labeled as dogs.

12
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,710
You can then use supervised learning to generalize from these examples and

13
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,630
predict how likely the image provided is a dog or not.

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,410
Each machine-learning algorithm has its own strengths and challenges

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,560
the strengths of supervised learning a simplicity

16
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,760
and ease of design.

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,340
However, labeling millions of new data takes time

18
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,070
and can be a challenging task.

19
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,170
Supervised learning algorithms

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,440
are used to solve classification or regression problems.

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,650
First, let's talk about one of the use cases, classification.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,340
Classification problems predicts which class or category

23
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,830
the object belongs to.

24
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,790
It is a process of sorting a given set of data into different classes.

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,940
The output of classification

26
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,420
are distinct values.

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,010
Binary classification predicts one of the two possible outcomes.

28
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,190
It predicts answers such as, "Is this email classified as spam or not?"

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,010
Multiclass classification predicts one of

30
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,460
multiple possible outcomes in problems.

31
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,810
For example, is this movie a romantic comedy, documentary, or thriller?

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,500
Some popular algorithms for classification include

33
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,220
logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, or KNN,

34
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,510
support vector machine, or SVM, random forest and Naive Bayes.

35
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,440
In contrast, regression problems predict

36
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,990
a numeric value from continuous outcomes.

37
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,220
The goal is to plot a best-fit line or a curve between the data.

38
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,490
For example,

39
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,630
you can use regression to predict what price will this house sell for.

40
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,420
Some popular algorithms for regression include linear regression,

41
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,940
k-nearest neighbor, or KNN, support vector machine, or SVM,

42
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,140
and random forest.

43
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,640
However, there is no single learning algorithm

44
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,530
that works best on all supervised learning problems.
