you can minimize capital expenditures associated with

29
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:28,629
purchasing and maintaining physical storage infrastructure.

30
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,050
With this pay as you go pricing model,

31
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:34,370

Data is encrypted in transit and at rest

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,459
while you maintain control over the encryption keys used for decryption

38
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,669
