1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,080
Machine Learning Algorithms.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,620
Machine learning or ML

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,600
can help solve a variety of business problems across many industries.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,690
An example of questions that ML can help a data scientist answer are,

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,670
Is this internet traffic pattern indicative of a hacker?

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,350
Does this mammography scan show signs of cancer?

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,720
Or how many days before this manufacturing part fails?

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,660
A data scientist must choose

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,990
the type of ML algorithm to use.

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,780
This decision is mostly dependent on the type of data available to train the model.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,240
If the training data includes both features and labels already defined,

12
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,830
then you can use a supervised learning algorithm.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,690
If the training data does not include labels,

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,480
then you would use an unsupervised learning algorithm.

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,560
Let us take a closer look at both types of algorithms.

16
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,890
Supervised Algorithms.

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,720
Linear Regression.

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,060
Linear-regression algorithms aim to learn the correlation

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,200
between a set of input features (x)

20
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,530
and a continuous output variable way.

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,900
The goal of the algorithm is to be able to predict a continuous numerical value.

22
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,260
For example,

23
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,770
a manufacturing engineer

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,970
knowing the number of weeks before a critical component fails is valuable,

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,090
allowing them to proactively schedule

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,360
focused maintenance, thereby reducing downtime.

27
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,650
Classification.

28
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,000
A classification algorithm's goal

29
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,860
is to understand the relationship

30
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,490
between feature data and an output label.

31
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,620
The end result should be

32
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,370
the ability of the ML model

33
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,700
to separate the data

34
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,110
into distinct groups.

35
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,010
For instance,

36
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,920
to predict customer sentiment, a company can collect data such as

37
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,510
age, gender, purchase history,

38
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,560
and customer service interactions.

39
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,380
The ML model can then use that data to compare how other customers

40
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,580
with similar features felt and then label their sentiment as happy or not happy.

41
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,660
Unsupervised Algorithms.

42
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,350
Clustering. Clustering algorithms analyze unordered input data

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,370
and attempts to label them into discrete groupings.

44
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,000
In this case, the unordered items have been analyzed

45
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,780
and labeled into three groups: fish, sheep, and cats.

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,930
The number of groupings

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
and the group labels are unknown

48
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,620
and part of the problem the ML model solves.

49
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,570
For example,

50
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,200
a clustering algorithm can be used to determine

51
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,180
what trending subjects are being discussed

52
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,720
in an organization's social media posts,

53
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,860
then cluster them into topics such as an upcoming merger,

54
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,470
a new product launch, or a service outage so they can be addressed by management.

55
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,420
Anomaly detection.

56
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,660
Anomaly-detection algorithms help solve a special type of ML problem

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,600
where the number of clusters is two.

58
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,760
This type of algorithm

59
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,990
excels at finding

60
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,510
unusual activity and large data sets.

61
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,580
Detecting intruders in a computer network

62
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,020
by analyzing log data is an anomaly-detection problem.

63
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,400
Unusual activity would be labeled as anomalous,

64
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,110
if it departed significantly from normal patterns.
