00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,540
AWS CloudTrail Overview.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:12,080
AWS CloudTrail is a fully managed service that records AWS API calls made to

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,890
Amazon Web Services,

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,500
or AWS accounts, helping you implement

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,670
governance,

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,700
compliance,

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,690
and operational and risk auditing

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,830
across your entire AWS infrastructure,

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,790
giving you control over

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,300
storage, analysis, and remediation actions.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,700
Actions taken by users

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,620
and AWS service

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,480
or an IAM role

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,490
are recorded as events and delivered to CloudTrail.

15
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,300
Events recorded include operations

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,100
done via the AWS Management Console,

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,550
AWS Command Line Interface,

18
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,140
or AWS CLI,

19
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,640
application program interfaces, or APIs,

20
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,240
and the various software development kits, or SDKs.

21
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,880
CloudTrail helps you answer the question of

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,950
who did what,

23
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,620
where,

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,370
and when.

25
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:08,840
When you create an AWS account, CloudTrail is enabled by default.

26
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,800
Recent activity can easily be viewed by going to

27
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,440
event history in the CloudTrail console.

28
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,410
You can deliver your CloudTrail event details to Amazon S3

29
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,680
or Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

30
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,730
CloudTrail's integration with Amazon EventBridge

31
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,100
provides a convenient way to create

32
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,760
rule-based alerts that trigger remediation workflows.

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,700
AWS CloudTrail Benefits.

34
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,780
Log file encryption.

35
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
By default,

36
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,410
AWS CloudTrail

37
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,660
encrypts all log files

38
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,580
delivered to Amazon S3,

39
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,610
using Amazon S3 server-side encryption,

40
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,230
or SSE-S3.

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,540
Or add a layer of protection to your log files by encrypting them with an

42
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,030
AWS Key Management Service,

43
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,540
or AWS KMS, key.

44
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,900
Amazon S3 automatically decrypts your log files

45
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,640
if you have the KMS decrypt action assigned to your IAM role.

46
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:12,260
You can also define Amazon S3 lifecycle rules

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,090
to archive and delete log files automatically.

48
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,360
CloudTrail Insights.

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,010
AWS CloudTrail Insights empowers users

50
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,110
to identify and respond to unusual activity

51
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,910
by continually monitoring

52
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,120
CloudTrail management events.

53
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,190
CloudTrail Insights can be viewed by

54
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,770
logging into the CloudTrail console,

55
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,960
or they can also be delivered to the

56
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,360
S3 bucket configured for your trail.

57
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,000
CloudTrail Insights events are recorded only

58
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,750
when CloudTrail detects

59
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,080
anomalies or

60
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,580
excessive API executions that vary from typical usage.

61
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,760
Multi-Account and Multi-Region.

62
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,060
AWS CloudTrail can be configured to record

63
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,730
events from multiple accounts and regions

64
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,220
and deliver them to a single AWS destination.

65
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,620
This ensures that accounts and regions

66
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,940
newly created behave consistently,

67
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,970
thereby eliminating the need for manual intervention.

68
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:15,400
If you use AWS Organizations to manage your AWS accounts,

69
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,410
you can create an organizational

70
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,800
trail from the Organizations management account.

71
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,440
Once created, it will log all events across your entire organizational hierarchy.
