and artificial intelligence framework.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,660
With TensorFlow,

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,210
you can use custom code

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,070
along with Amazon SageMaker

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,810
to train and deploy a machine-learning model.

9
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:27,240
The SageMaker Python SDK, along with the open-source TensorFlow containers,

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,060
makes it easy to write TensorFlow taining scripts.

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,000
TensorFlow 2

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,940
focuses on simplicity and ease of use

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,130
with updated features like eager execution,

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,430
intuitive high-level APIs,

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,810
and flexible model building on any platform.

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,960
TensorFlow Framework Benefits.

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,270
Easy Model Building.

18
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,990
TensorFlow offers multiple levels of abstraction

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,310
for their APIs.

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,820
Using the Keras API,

21
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,610
quickly build and train ML models to get started with machine learning.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,510
The distributed strategy API

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,820
lets you distribute larger training jobs across multiple

24
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,340
hardware configurations with minimal or no code changes.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,370
Robust ML Production Anywhere.

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,330
Whether it's on servers,

27
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,400
edge devices, or the cloud,

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,430
TensorFlow lets you train and deploy your models anywhere,

29
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,050
no matter what language your platform uses.

30
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,760
Powerful Experimentation for Research.

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,030
Build and train

32
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,580
state-of-art ML models without sacrificing speed or performance.

33
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,350
TensorFlow also supports an ecosystem

34
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,160
of powerful add-on libraries and models to experiment with.

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,620
This includes ragged tensors,

36
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,340
TensorFlow probability, Tensor2Tensor, BERT and Mixture of Experts.
