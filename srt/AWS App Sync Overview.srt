00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,340
AWS AppSync Overview. AWS AppSync simplifies application development

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,820
by letting you create a flexible

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,960
API to securely access, manipulate, and combine data from one or more data sources.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,590
AppSync is a managed service that uses GraphQL to make

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,680
it easy for applications to get exactly the data they need.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,130
With AppSync you can build scalable

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,590
applications including those requiring real-time

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,720
updates on a range of data sources such as NoSQL datastores,

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:34,760
relational databases, HTTP APIs, and your custom data sources with AWS Lambda.

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,410
For mobile and web apps,

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,510
AppSync additionally provides local data access when devices go offline

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,730
and data synchronization with customizable conflict

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,490
resolution when they are back online.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,400
Here are the benefits of using AWS AppSync.

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,080
With AppSync you can get started in minutes

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,220
directly from your IDE of choice, using the AppSync Management Console

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,940
or the AWS Amplify CLI to

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,000
automatically generate your API and client-side code.

19
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,130
AWS AppSync integrates with Amazon DynamoDB,

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,330
Amazon Aurora,

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,760
Amazon Elasticsearch,

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,990
AWS Lambda, and other AWS services,

23
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,760
enabling you to create sophisticated applications

24
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,240
with virtually unlimited throughput and storage

25
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,270
that scale according to your business needs.

26
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,070
AWS AppSync enables real-time subscriptions across millions of

27
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,170
devices as well as offline access to app data.

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,030
When an offline device reconnects,

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,860
AWS AppSync automatically syncs only the updates that occurred when

30
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,780
the device was disconnected and not the entire data set.

31
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,920
AppSync offers user customizable server-side

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,230
conflict detection and resolution that does

33
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,650
the heavy lifting of managing data conflicts so you don't have to.

34
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,170
AppSync also allows you to perform complex queries and aggregation across

35
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,030
multiple data sources with a single network call using GraphQL.

36
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,260
AWS AppSync makes it easy to secure your

37
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,470
app data using multiple concurrent authentication modes

38
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,680
as well as allowing to define security

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,570
and fine-grained access control at the data-definition level,

40
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,630
directly from your GraphQL schema.
