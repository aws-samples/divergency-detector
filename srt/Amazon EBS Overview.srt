00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,690
Amazon Elastic Block Store Overview.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,260
Amazon Elastic Block Store, or Amazon EBS,

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,140
is a service that provides block-level storage volumes

4
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:11,470
for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, or

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,159
EC2, instances.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,120
EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices in the cloud.

7
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:22,139
You can mount EBS volumes as a device on your EC2 instance.

8
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:26,059
Each EBS volume can be attached to only one instance at a time,

9
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:29,399
but multiple volumes of EBS can be on the same instance.

10
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:33,919
Since EBS volumes are mounted to the instances,

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,529
they can provide single-digit millisecond latency,

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,650
which is extremely low latency between where the data is stored

13
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,479
and where it might be used on the instance.

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,189
EBS volumes are designed for both

15
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:47,459
throughput- and transaction-intensive workloads at any scale.

16
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:50,360
Amazon EBS offers data persistence.

17
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,770
All the data on the attached EBS volume remains available

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,099
even after you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance.

19
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:01,900
Amazon EBS provides two major storage volume types.

20
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:07,580
Solid-state drive, or SSD-backed storage, and hard disk drive, or HDD-backed storage.

21
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,180
SSD-backed storage is optimized for transactional workloads, which

22
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,370
involve frequent read/write operations with small I/O size.

23
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:19,739
Some use case examples include databases and boot volumes.

24
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:22,809
SSD-backed volumes include the highest-performance

25
00:01:22,809 --> 00:01:25,769
provisioned IOPS SSD, io2 and io1,

26
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:28,379
for latency-sensitive transactional workloads.

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,300
General-purpose SSD volumes, gp3 and gp2,

28
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,959
balance price and performance for a wide variety of transactional data.

29
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,760
gp3 volumes enable customers

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,709
to provision performance independent of storage capacity.

31
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:47,230
The dominant performance for SSD-backed volumes depends primarily on IOPS (input/output operations per sec).

32
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,290
HDD-backed storage is for throughput-intensive workloads such as MapReduce,

33
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,540
data warehouse, and log processing.

34
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,279
HDD-backed volumes include throughput-optimized HDD,

35
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:05,269
st1, for frequently accessed throughput-intensive workloads.

36
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,380
The lowest cost Cold HDD, sc1, is for less frequently accessed data.

37
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:14,949
Dominant performance for HDD-backed volumes depends primarily

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,369
on throughput measured in megabytes per second.
