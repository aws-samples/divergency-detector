00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,450
Machine Learning Overview.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,600
Machine learning, or ML, is the process of teaching a machine

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,000
or a computer how to perform a task such as identifying

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,470
fraudulent credit card transactions.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,000
Before machine learning,

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,610
using classical programming,

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,630
developers spent many hours creating logic rules and applying them

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,420
to a specific dataset to calculate an answer.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,510
Now, with machine learning,

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,670
developers can create computer algorithms that can learn from experience

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,000
without relying on rules-based programming,

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,280
thereby moving the heavy lifting away from humans and onto machines.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,670
Machine learning is good at solving problems like predicting the

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,790
price of a book based on its features, such as

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,150
the number of pages,

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:47,900
the author,

17
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,950
and whether it has a hard cover or not.

18
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,190
It also excels at solving classification problems like determining

19
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,120
whether a movie review is positive or negative.

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,420
Machine Learning Components.

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,690
Data.

22
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,580
The data to solve

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,410
a machine-learning task consists of features and a label.

24
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,580
Feature data are the inputs, or x-variable,

25
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,520
the known attributes about the problem your task is trying to solve.

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,060
Label data is the output, or y-variable,

27
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,620
the value or attribute you are trying to predict.

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,880
ML data types can be either categorical, such as a movie genre,

29
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,880
or numerical, such as a book price.

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,760
Algorithms.

31
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,770
A machine-learning algorithm is a set of instructions

32
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,080
a computer runs to determine the rules that allow it

33
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,740
to predict a label or output in a dataset.

34
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,370
There are two types of machine-learning algorithms.

35
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,320
Supervised ML algorithms use data with labels

36
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,730
or the observed output, already included with the feature data.

37
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,290
Supervised ML algorithms are suited for solving

38
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,260
problems involving linear regression and classification.

39
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,890
With unsupervised ML,

40
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,480
the labels are not provided as part of the input.

41
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,090
Unsupervised ML algorithms are better at solving clustering

42
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,770
problems that find naturally occurring groupings.

43
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,850
Machine Learning Lifecycle.

44
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,080
The machine-learning lifecycle involves determining the business

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,820
problem with goals that are specific and measurable,

46
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,960
defining the machine-learning model by

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,660
rephrasing the problem using ML terminology,

48
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,650
and then identifying the type of algorithm that is best suited for the task.

49
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,630
The next step is to prepare the data,

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,850
which requires gathering, merging,

51
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,580
and cleaning up features and label data.

52
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,480
Once the data is ready,

53
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,020
you train and test the model

54
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,140
and tune hyper-parameters until the desired accuracy is achieved.

55
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,960
The final step is to deploy the model to production and then

56
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,440
evaluate it to improve the predictions by iterating over the previous steps.
