Amazon Relational Database Service Features

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,130
- Lower Administrative Burden and Performance.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,240
First, let's start with the features that help you lower administrative burden.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,610
It is easy to use. When you create an Amazon RDS DB instance,

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,610
you can choose the database engine, storage capacity,

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,710
CPU, and memory of the instance.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,400
The DB instance class determines the computation and

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,970
memory capacity available to a DB instance.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,930
Amazon RDS supports three types of DB instance classes.

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,180
Standard for general-purpose instances, memory-optimized,

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,410
for memory-intensive applications, and burstable

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,320
performance DB instance class for

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,190
burstable instances with the ability to burst to full CPU usage.

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,140
Amazon RDS database instances are preconfigured with parameters and

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,280
settings appropriate for the engine and class you have selected.

16
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,710
You can launch a database instance and connect your application within minutes.

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,030
In addition, DB parameter groups provide granular

18
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,090
control and fine-tuning of your database.

19
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,020
A DB parameter group acts as a container for engine configuration values

20
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,440
that are applied to one or more DB instances.

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,050
Automatic software patching. RDS will make

22
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,280
sure that the relational database software

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,470
powering your deployment stays up to date with the latest patches.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,120
You can exert optional control over when and if your database instance is patched.

25
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,640
Best-practice recommendation.

26
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,060
Amazon RDS provides best-practice guidance by analyzing configuration

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,180
and usage metrics from your database instances.

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,730
Recommendations cover areas such as database engine versions,

29
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,490
storage, instance types, and networking.

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,330
You can browse the available recommendations and perform a recommended action

31
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,020
immediately, schedule it for the next maintenance window, or dismiss it entirely.

32
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,500
Performance. Amazon RDS provides three storage types which

33
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,680
differ in performance, characteristics, and price,

34
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,210
which means that you can tailor your storage performance

35
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,540
and cost to the needs of your database workload.

36
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,250
Amazon RDS general-purpose storage, also known as gp2,

37
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,380
is an SSD-backed storage option

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,440
that delivers a consistent baseline of three IOPS per provisioned gigabyte and

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,850
provides the ability to burst up to 3,000 IOPS above the baseline.

40
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,500
This storage type is suitable for a broad range of database workloads.

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,550
Amazon RDS-provisioned IOPS storage, also known as io1,

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,670
is an SSD-backed storage option that is designed to deliver fast,

43
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,210
predictable, and consistent

44
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,050
I/O performance.

45
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,400
You specify an IOPS rate when creating a database instance, and Amazon RDS

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,640
provisions that IOPS rate for the lifetime of the database instance.

47
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,340
This storage type is optimized for I/O-intensive

48
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,920
transactional OLTP database workloads.

49
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,560
You can provision up to 40,000 IOPS per database instance.

50
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,210
In addition, Amazon RDS also supports magnetic storage,

51
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,950
also known as standard storage,

52
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,520
for backward compatibility.

53
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,350
We recommend that you use general-purpose SSD,

54
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,910
or provisioned IOPS, for any new storage needs.
