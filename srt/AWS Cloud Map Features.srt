00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
AWS Cloud Map Features.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,480
Here are the key features.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,430
Discover resources via API calls or DNS queries.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,580
Cloud Map allows your applications to discover any web-based service

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,800
via AWS SDK, API calls, or DNS queries.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,390
Using the Discovery API.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,080
Cloud Map can return URLs or Amazon resource names, or ARNs,

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:31,190
as well as IP addresses and IP port combinations using either IPv4 or IPv6.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:38,200
Over DNS, Cloud Map provides resource locations of IP addresses or IP port combinations.

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,080
Simplified service naming.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,100
AWS Cloud Map lets you define simple custom names for services in your application.

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,140
This can include Amazon Elastic Container Service, or ECS, tasks,

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:57,160
Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon DynamoDB tables,

14
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,750
Amazon Simple Queue Service, or SQS, queues, and any other cloud resource.

15
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,030
Assigned custom attributes.

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,980
Cloud Map lets you define custom attributes for each resource,

17
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,590
such as location and deployment stage.

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,160
This enables attribute-based service discovery,

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,090
which filters based on the attributes you specify in your discovery query.

20
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,380
Access control.

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,280
Cloud Map is integrated with AWS Identity and Access Management, or AWS IAM,

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,840
to ensure that only authenticated services can discover resources within the registry ,

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,740
and retrieve the location and credential for those resources.

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,100
Automatic health check.

25
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:44,510
AWS Cloud Map can provision Amazon Route 53 health checks for resources.

26
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,630
Amazon Route 53 health checks ensure that only

27
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,610
healthy endpoints are returned on discovery queries.

28
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,680
This ensures that Cloud Map always has an up-to-date registry of healthy resources.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,800
With the health status information,

30
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,130
smart traffic routing can quickly stop

31
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,460
traffic routing to the unhealthy resources.

32
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,180
AWS Cloud Map also supports custom health checks.

33
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,570
You can control when to start and stop traffic routing.

34
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,720
You can set status to healthy or unhealthy to control the routing.

35
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,030
Deep integration with AWS container services.

36
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,860
Services and tasks managed by Amazon Elastic Container Service, or ECS,

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,580
or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, or EKS,

38
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,650
can be automatically registered and updated in Cloud Map.

39
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,040
Rapid change propagation.

40
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,640
When you're using API-based discovery with AWS Cloud Map,

41
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,340
the updates on your resource locations and attributes

42
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,370
are available within five seconds.

43
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,370
Fully managed.

44
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,830
AWS Cloud Map eliminates the need to set up,

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,600
update, and manage your own service discovery tools and software.
