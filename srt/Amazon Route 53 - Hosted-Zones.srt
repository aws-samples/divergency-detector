1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,640
Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zones.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,270
A Route 53 hosted zone

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,109
is a container for managing

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,780
Domain Name Service,

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,200
or DNS, records.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,480
Those records hold information

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,390
about how you want to route

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,760
IP traffic for a specific domain

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,200
such as

10
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,790
example.com

11
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,120
and its subdomains,

12
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,900
www.example.com or

13
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,670
jobs.example.com.

14
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,450
There are two types of hosted zones,

15
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,610
public hosted zones and private hosted zones.

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,850
When you create a hosted zone,

17
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,460
it shares the name with the

18
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,500
domain you want to route traffic for.

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,810
Route 53 Public Hosted Zones.

20
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,650
A public hosted zone

21
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,430
holds the information

22
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,150
about how you want to route traffic external to AWS.

23
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,310
For an internet domain such as mycompany.com,

24
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,710
you then create DNS records

25
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,970
in the hosted zone to make a mapping

26
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,700
between a domain name

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,370
such as jobs.mycompany.com.

28
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,030
that route to external-facing AWS resources

29
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,440
like a CloudFront distribution or an EC2 instance

30
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,390
as well as route to on-premises servers.

31
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,220
When you create a public hosted zone,

32
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,560
Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a name server, or NS, record

33
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,270
and the start-of-authority, or SOA,

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,510
record for the zone.

35
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,990
The NS record identifies the four name servers

36
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,320
that you provide to the registrar so that

37
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,090
DNS queries are resolved successfully.

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,880
Route 53 Private Hosted Zones.

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,100
A private hosted zone contains the details

40
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,690
about how you want Amazon Route 53

41
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,530
to respond to DNS queries for domains

42
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,380
or

43
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,090
subdomains within one or more VPCs

44
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,030
created by Amazon VPC service.

45
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,680
Using private hosted zones requires

46
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,570
that you can figure Amazon VPC settings

47
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,210
and set the properties

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,360
enableDnsHostnames

49
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,370
and enableDnsSupport to true.

50
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,660
Private hosted zones only allow you to use

51
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,850
the following routing policies.

52
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,180
Simple routing,

53
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,810
failover routing,

54
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,730
multi-value answer routing,

55
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,240
or weighted routing.

56
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,980
By creating a private hosted and

57
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,320
public hosted zone with the same name,

58
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,700
you can create what is known as a split-view DNS.

59
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,560
Split-view DNS allows routing of DNS queries

60
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,240
to internal and external resources

61
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,270
depending on the request origin.

62
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,300
From a VPC, queries will go to the private hosted zone,

63
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,930
and the answer will route back to an internal-facing resource.

64
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,130
Internet queries will go to the public hosted zone,

65
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,040
and the response will route

66
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,400
to an external-facing resource.
