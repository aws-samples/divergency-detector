00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Hello and welcome to AWS Well-Architected Overview.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,880
AWS Well-Architected helps cloud architects design infrastructure

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,540
that is built around six pillars.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,030
Operational excellence, security, reliability,

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,420
performance efficiency,

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,800
cost optimization,

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,340
and sustainability.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,530
The AWS Well-Architected framework includes hands-on labs,

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,880
access to the AWS Well-Architected Partner Program,

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,260
and the AWS Well-Architected Tool,

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,020
which architects can use to evaluate workloads,

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,840
identify high-risk issues,

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,260
and record improvements.

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,640
Let us take a closer look at the six pillars that define

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,970
an AWS Well-Architected design.

16
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,740
The operational-excellence pillar focuses on running and

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:49,060
monitoring systems and continually improving processes and procedures.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,460
The security pillar focuses on protecting information and systems.

19
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,250
The reliability pillar focuses on ensuring workloads perform their assigned

20
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,990
functions and recover quickly from any failure to meet demands.

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,200
The performance-efficiency pillar focuses on

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,960
selecting suitable resource types and sizes,

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,350
monitoring performance,

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,980
and maintaining efficiency.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,670
The cost-optimization pillar focuses on understanding spending trends,

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,310
controlling fund allocation,

27
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,160
and scaling to meet business needs without overspending.

28
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,800
The sustainability pillar focuses on minimizing the

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,540
environmental impact of running your cloud workloads,

30
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,170
such as energy consumption and resource use.

31
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,250
How does the AWS Well-Architected Tool help create a Well-Architected infrastructure?

32
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,600
The AWS Well-Architected Tool extends the Well-Architected functionality,

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,700
best practices, measurements,

34
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,740
and learnings into your existing architecture processes, applications,

35
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,870
and workflows.

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,150
It creates custom lenses where you can add best-practices

37
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,820
pillars and questions based on what's most important to your organization.

38
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,910
Using the tool,

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,960
you can share your workloads and custom lenses with up to 300 individual

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,170
AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM,

41
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,600
users or accounts or across an entire organization.

42
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,110
Reviewing your workload against sustainability

43
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,240
best practices in the AWS Well-Architected Tool

44
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,640
can help you understand energy consumption and environmental impact.

45
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:26,300
The AWS Well-Architected Tool is available in the AWS GovCloud Region of the US.

46
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,690
So customers with specific regulatory and

47
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,060
compliance requirements can conduct self-service

48
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,490
public-sector reviews.

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,660
You can learn more about the

50
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,940
AWS Well-Architected Tool and custom lenses by

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,830
visiting the AWS Well-Architected website.
