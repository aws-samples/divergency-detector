00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,510
Simple setup.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,930
It's easy to get started with AWS X-Ray.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,480
You just integrate the X-Ray SDK with your application

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,130
and install the X-Ray agent.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,630
End-to-end tracing.

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,040
AWS X-Ray provides an end-to-end, cross-service

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,790
view of requests made to your application.

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,120
AWS Service and Database Integrations.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,450
AWS X-Ray supports applications running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud,

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,070
or Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Container Service, or

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,170
Amazon ECS, AWS Lambda, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,130
In addition,

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,970
the X-Ray SDK captures metadata for requests made to MySQL

16
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:55,200
and PostgreSQL databases such as self-hosted Amazon RDS,

17
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,650
Amazon Aurora, and Amazon DynamoDB.

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,440
It also captures metadata for requests made to Amazon Simple Queue Service, or SQS,

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,730
and Amazon Simple Notification Service, or SNS.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,680
Support for multiple languages.

21
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,150
AWS X-Ray supports tracing for applications that are written

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,770
in Java, Python, Node.js, Ruby, .NET, and Go.

23
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,400
Request sampling.

24
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,930
You can set the trace sampling rate that is best

25
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,630
suited for your production applications or applications in development.

26
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,310
X-Ray continually traces requests made to your application and

27
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,770
stores a sampling of the requests for your analysis.

28
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,590
This provides you with the appropriate amount of data to make your

29
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,060
analysis meaningful, while avoiding the overhead

30
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,720
of storing and managing excessive data volume.

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,820
Console and programmatic access.

32
00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:02,640
You can use AWS X-Ray with the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs.

33
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,310
The X-Ray API

34
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,960
lets you programmatically access the service so you can easily export

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,780
trace data or ingest the data into your own tools and custom analytics dashboards.

36
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,310
Service map.

37
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,460
AWS X-Ray creates a map of services used by your application with

38
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,830
trace data that you can use to drill into specific services or issues.

39
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,040
This provides a view of connections between services in your application.

40
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,790
For each service,

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,190
it also provides aggregated data including the number

42
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,900
of traces that is sent per minute,

43
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,870
average latency, and failure rates.

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,130
Server- and client-side latency detection.

45
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,740
AWS X-Ray allows you to visually detect node

46
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,880
and edge latency distribution directly from the service map.

47
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,780
You can quickly isolate outliers, graph patterns and trends,

48
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,930
drill into traces,

49
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,650
and filter by built-in keys and custom annotations

50
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,630
to better understand performance issues

51
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,980
impacting your application and end users.

52
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,710
Data annotation and filtering.

53
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,670
AWS X-Ray lets you add annotations to data

54
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,070
emitted from specific components or services in your application.

55
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,870
You can use this to append business-specific

56
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,560
metadata that help you better diagnose issues.

57
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,010
You can also view and filter data for traces by properties such as annotation value,

58
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:34,820
average latencies, HTTP response status, timestamp, database table used, and more. Security.

59
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,430
AWS X-Ray is integrated with AWS Identity and Access Management,

60
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,340
or AWS IAM, so that you can control which users

61
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,220
and resources have permission to access your traces and how.
