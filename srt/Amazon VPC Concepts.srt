00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,200
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Concepts.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,690
The following are some of the key concepts for VPCs.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,810
When you create a VPC,

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,790
you must specify a range of private IP addresses for

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,020
the VPC in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing, or CIDR,

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,500
block notation.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,440
The allowed CIDR block size is between a /16 and /28,

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,930
for example, this IPv4 CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16 notation.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,340
When you write this out in 32 bits binary, you get the following:

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,340
The number followed by the slash symbol, in this case 16,

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,150
means that the first 16 bits remains fixed.

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,260
And you can vary the next 16 bits,

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,000
providing you with a total of 65,536 IP address ranges.

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,700
A CIDR block of 0.0.0.0/0

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,870
would allow access to any IP address.

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,790
To the original primary CIDR block,

17
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,320
you can assign additional private IP addresses,

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,420
a secondary CIDR block, to expand your VPC.

19
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,430
Private IP addresses are local addresses in your VPC.

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,630
They are not reachable over the internet.

21
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,390
They are used for communication between the instances in your VPC.

22
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,890
To connect to your instance over the internet,

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,990
you can assign a globally unique public IPv4 address to your instance.

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,600
On the other hand,

25
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,220
IPv6 addresses are public and reachable over the internet.

26
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,480
When you create a VPC with CIDR block such as 10.0.0.0/16,

27
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,840
note that you will not have all 65,536 IP addresses.

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,930
It is because five IP addresses are reserved by AWS for internal use.

29
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,250
To create more than one subnet in your VPC,

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,060
make sure that the CIDR blocks do not overlap.

31
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:52,140
That's why we specify 10.0.10.0 and 10.0.20.0 for the two subnets.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,490
/24 indicates assigning 251 IP addresses for the subnet.

33
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,710
When you create a VPC,

34
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,520
it automatically has a main route table by default.

35
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,030
You can also create your custom route tables.

36
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,740
A route table contains a set of rules, called routes,

37
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,260
that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

38
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,590
Each route in a table specifies a destination and a target.

39
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,270
This main route table shows a local route that

40
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,630
enables communication for all resources within this VPC.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,760
Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table.

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,180
You use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet,

43
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,090
and a private subnet for resources that won't be connected to the internet.

44
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,540
You can make a subnet a public subnet by adding a

45
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,260
route in your subnet route table to an internet gateway

46
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,390
to support inbound and outbound access to the public internet.

47
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,110
On the other hand,

48
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,200
private subnet does not have a route

49
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,200
to an internet gateway in the subnet route table.

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,760
Also note that

51
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,120
most architectures allocate significantly more

52
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,500
IP addresses available for private subnets

53
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,860
than for public subnets.
