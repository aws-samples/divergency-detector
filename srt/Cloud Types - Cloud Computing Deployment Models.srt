00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,630
Welcome to Types of Cloud Computing Deployment Models.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,630
There are three types of cloud computing deployment models: on-premises,

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,860
cloud and hybrid.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,810
On-premises deployment model is the same as the legacy IT infrastructure.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,840
Physical servers, databases,

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,430
applications, and storage are located in their own facilities.

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,290
Applications are deployed and run on these physical servers.

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,020
On-premises deployment does not provide many of the benefits of cloud computing,

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,830
but it is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources.

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,580
Cloud deployment model.

11
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,660
In the cloud model,

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,270
IT resources and applications are migrated

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,260
from existing infrastructure to the cloud.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Physical servers are replaced by scalable virtual servers.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,790
A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud,

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,970
and all parts of the application run in the cloud

17
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,590
taking advantage of the benefits of cloud computing.

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,090
Hybrid cloud deployment model.

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,310
Hybrid cloud is a mixture of cloud and on-premises computing.

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,540
The existing on-premises infrastructure can satisfy your need for control,

21
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,540
latency, and sensitive data security requirements

22
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,310
while connecting cloud resources to your internal systems.

23
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,080
At the same time,

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,300
you can extend your existing infrastructure and grow to the cloud.

25
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,280
Each type of cloud computing model and deployment

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,760
method provides you with different levels of control,

27
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,450
flexibility, and management.

28
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,890
Understanding their differences can help you decide what

29
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,990
set of services is right for your needs.
