Amazon S3 Overview.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:07,860
Amazon Simple Storage Service, or Amazon S3, is an object-storage service.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,820
An object consists of data and metadata.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,930
The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,040
Buckets are containers for objects stored in S3.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,680
An object is uniquely identified within a bucket by a key.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,310
The object named photo/puppy.jpg is stored in the john smith bucket.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,710
And it is addressable using this URL:

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:41,280
http://johnsmith.S3.<region>.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg

10
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,670
Amazon S3 offers industry-leading scalability,

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,030
data availability,

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,730
security, and performance.

13
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,270
Customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,230
and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases,

15
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,750
such as websites,

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,890
mobile apps, backup and restore, archive, enterprise apps,

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,450
IoT devices, and big data analytics.

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,370
Amazon S3 offers industry-leading performance, scalability,

19
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,790
availability, and durability.

20
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,050
It can easily meet fluctuating demands by automatically scaling your storage

21
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,030
resources up and down without up-front

22
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,510
investments or resource procurement cycles.

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,080
Amazon S3 is designed for eleven 9s of data durability,

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,670
because it automatically creates and stores copies of

25
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,400
all S3 objects across multiple systems.

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,570
This means your data is available when needed and protected against failures,

27
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,670
errors, and threats.

28
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,580
Amazon S3 also offers unmatched security,

29
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,720
compliance, and audit capabilities.

30
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,590
It secures your data from unauthorized access

31
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,430
with encryption features and access management tools.

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,660
S3 is the only object-storage service that allows you

33
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,490
to block public access to all of your objects at the bucket

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,680
or the account level

35
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,730
with S3 Block Public Access.

36
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,470
You should enable Block Public Access for all accounts

37
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,040
and buckets that you do not want publicly accessible.

38
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,370
S3 maintains compliance programs,

39
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,780
such as PCI DSS, HIPAA/HITECH, FedRAMP,

40
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,520
EU Data Protection Directive, and FISMA, to help you meet regulatory requirements.

41
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,620
AWS also supports numerous auditing capabilities to

42
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,860
monitor access requests to your S3 resources.

43
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,170
Amazon S3 is the most supported cloud-storage service.

44
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,350
You can choose to work with a partner from the AWS Partner Network, or APN,

45
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,910
which is the largest community of

46
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,980
technology and consulting cloud services providers.

47
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,120
The migration partners can help you to transfer data to Amazon S3.

48
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,230
The storage partners offer S3-integrated solutions for primary

49
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,010
storage, backup and restore, archive, and disaster recovery.

50
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,800
You can also purchase an

51
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,790
AWS-integrated solution directly from the AWS Marketplace,

52
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,470
which lists over 250 storage-specific offerings.
