1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,630
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Volume Types.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,080
Let's compare the different EBS volume types.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,240
The general-purpose SSD volumes gp3 and gp2

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,960
are designed to offer single-digit millisecond latency.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,600
gp2 is designed to deliver a consistent baseline performance of 3 IOPS per gigabytes

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,660
and can burst up to 3000 IOPS.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,380
It also provides a maximum of 16,000 IOPS per volume

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,380
and up to 250 megabytes per second of maximum throughput per volume.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,980
gp3 enables you to provision performance independent of storage.

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,300
It delivers a baseline performance of 3000 IOPS

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,620
and can scale up to 16,000 IOPS,

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,640
and throughput up to 1000 megabytes per second,

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,160
which is four times more throughput than gp2.

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,900
gp3 and gp2 have the same volume size of one gigabyte to 16 terabytes.

15
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,360
Next, let's look at the provisioned IOPS SSD volumes io2 and io1.

16
00:00:56,633 --> 00:01:00,530
They are designed to deliver up to a maximum of 64,000 IOPS,

17
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,460
four times more than gp3 and 1000 megabytes per second of throughput per volume,

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,640
along with single-digit millisecond latency.

19
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,120
They have the same volume size of four gigabytes to 16 terabytes.

20
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:18,620
However, io2 is designed to provide 100 times more durability of 99.999%

21
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,560
compared to that of io1 and all other volume types.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,240
Customers that need submillisecond latency

23
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,060
or need to go beyond the current single-volume peak performance and throughput

24
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:33,399
can use io2 Block Express which is designed to deliver four times higher IOPS, throughput,

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,440
and capacity than io2 volumes along with a high durability as io2.

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,540
Now let's look at the throughput-optimized HDD volumes.

27
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,080
st1 can burst up to 250 megabytes per second per terabyte

28
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,660
with a baseline throughput of 40 megabytes per second per terabyte.

29
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:56,366
It offers a maximum throughput of 500 megabytes per second and up to 500 IOPS per volume.

30
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:00,499
Similar to st1, cold HDD sc1 provides a burst model.

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,860
These volumes can burst up to 80 megabytes per second per terabyte

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,230
with a baseline throughput of 12 megabytes per second per terabyte,

33
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,920
and a maximum throughput of 250 megabytes per second for volume.

34
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,580
The maximum IOPS per volume for sc1 is 250 IOPS.

35
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,560
Both sc1 and st1 have the same volume size of 500 gigabytes to 16 terabytes.

36
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,840
As you can see, Amazon EBS provides all these different volume types

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,060
so that you can tailor your storage, performance, and cost to the needs of your applications.
