00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,000
text, and activities as well as detect any inappropriate content.

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,540
Amazon Rekognition also provides highly accurate facial analysis and

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,410
facial recognition on images and video that you provide.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,160

Amazon Rekognition is based on the same proven, highly scalable

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,530
deep-learning technology developed by Amazon's computer vision scientists

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,320
to analyze billions of images and videos daily.

18
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,780

you only pay for the number of images

37
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:10,590
or minutes of video you analyze and the face data you store for facial recognition.

38
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,350

43
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,380
Amazon Rekognition offers the following key features:

44
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,440
object, scene, and activity detection.

45
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,320
With Amazon Rekognition, you can identify thousands of objects,

46
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,070
in this example, objects such as building, car, bicycle, and scene such as city.

47
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,330
When analyzing video,

48
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,460
you can also identify specific activities happening in the frame,

49
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,960
such as delivering a package or playing soccer.

50
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,790
Pathing.

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,620

you can capture the path of people in the scene.

53
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,380
For example,

54
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,120
you can use the movement of athletes during a

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,560
game to identify plays for post-game analysis,

56
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,370
Facial recognition.

57
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,300
Amazon Rekognition offers fast and accurate search capability.

58
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,640
This allows you to identify a person in a photo

59
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,110
or video using your private repository of face images.

60
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,640
It also supports crowd-mode face detection which can detect,

61
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,970
analyze, and index up to 100 faces in a single image.

62
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,680

63
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,700
Amazon Rekognition helps you identify potentially unsafe

64
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,220
or inappropriate content across both image and video assets.

65
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,870
Rekognition provides a hierarchical list of labels with confidence scores.

66
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,580
It also provides a range of different moderation levels,

67
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,340
from explicit too suggestive.

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,740
This information allows you to accurately control and filter

69
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,780
what you want to allow based on your needs,

70
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,040
and what is appropriate for the culture and demographics of your users.

Facial analysis.

72
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,440
You can analyze the attributes of faces in images

73
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,120
and videos you provide to determine things like

74
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,390
demographic data such as gender

75
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,440
and age range,

76
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,630
emotions such as happiness,

77
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,920
and general attributes such as eyes open and glasses, etc.

78
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,920
In video, you can also measure how these things change over time,

79
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,399
such as constructing a timeline of the emotions expressed by an actor.

80
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,580
Celebrity Recognition.

81
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,120
