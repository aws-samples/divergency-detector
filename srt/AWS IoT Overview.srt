00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,958
AWS-IoT Overview

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:12,000
AWS IoT, or Internet of Things, provides
the cloud services that connect IoT devices to other devices in AWS cloud services.

3
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:19,833
AWS IoT provides device software that can
help integrate your IoT devices into AWS IoT-based solutions.

4
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:26,958
AWS IoT Core supports connections with IoT
devices, wireless gateways, services, and apps.

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:35,775
Devices connect to AWS IoT Core so that
they can send data to and receive data from AWS IoT services and other devices.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,656
Apps and other services also connect to
AWS IoT Core to control and manage IoT devices and process the data from your IoT solution.

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:53,833
AWS IoT Core supports different protocols such as MQTT, or Message Queuing and Telemetry
Transport.

8
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,833
MQTT over WSS, or WebSockets Secure.

9
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:04,500
MQTT over HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer
Protocol Secure, LoRaWAN, or Long Range Wide Area Network.

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,375
AWS IoT Core Services

11
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,375
AWS IoT Core Messaging Services

12
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:17,263
The AWS IoT Core connectivity services
provide secure communication with IoT devices

13
00:01:17,263 --> 00:01:21,663
and manage the messages that pass between
the devices in AWS IoT.

14
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:27,666
The Device Gateway enables devices to
securely and efficiently communicate with AWS IoT.

15
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:35,250
The message broker provides a secure
mechanism for devices and AWS IoT applications to publish and receive messages from each other.

16
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:41,291
AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN, which is a
low-power, wide-area networking protocol.

17
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,583
makes it possible to set up a private
LoRaWAN network by connecting your LoRaWAN devices.

18
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:51,751
and gateways to AWS without the need to
develop and operate a LoRaWAN network server.

19
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:52,875
LNS

20
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:59,808
The rules engine connects data from the
message broker to other AWS IoT services for storage and additional processing.

21
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,125
AWS IoT Core Control Services

22
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:09,749
The AWS IoT Core control services provide
device security, management, and registration features.

23
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:21,458
Using the Custom Authentication Service,
you can define custom authorizes to provide authentication and authorization using different strategies, such as JSON Web Token Verification or OAuth Provider Callout.

24
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:25,625
Using the Device Provisioning Service, you
can provision devices 

25
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,625
using a template that describes 

26
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:32,083
a Thing object, a Certificate, and one or
more policies.

27
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:37,708
Using the group registry, you can manage
several devices at once by categorizing them into groups.

28
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:45,590
Using the job service, you can define a
set of remote operations that are sent to and run on one or more devices connected to AWS IoT.

29
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:51,541
Using the registry, you can organize the
resources associated with each device in the AWS cloud.

30
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:58,291
Using the Security and Identity Service,
you can provide shared responsibility for security in the AWS cloud.

31
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,291
AWS IoT Core Data Services

32
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:10,016
The AWS IoT Core data services help the
IoT solutions provide a reliable application experience even with devices that are not always connected.

33
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:16,000
A device shadow is a JSON document used to
store and retrieve current state information for a device.

34
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:24,291
The device shadow service maintains a
device's state so that applications can communicate with the device, whether the device is online or not.

35
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,375
AWS IoT Core Support Services

36
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:35,541
Amazon Sidewalk integration for AWS IoT
Core is a shared network that improves connectivity options to help devices work together better.
