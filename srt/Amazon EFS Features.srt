1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,866
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) Features.

2
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:07,630
Storage Classes and Lifecycle Management.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,520
Amazon EFS offers two storage classes,

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,240
the standard storage class and the infrequent access storage class, or EFS IA.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,780
The standard storage class is used to store frequently accessed files.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,760
The infrequent access, or IA, is a lower-cost storage class

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,830
that's designed for storing files not accessed every day.

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,020
You can start using EFS IA

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,880
by simply enabling EFS Lifecycle Management for your file system.

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,260
When enabled, lifecycle management migrates files

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,860
that have not been accessed for a set period of time

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,900
to the infrequent access, or IA, storage class.

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,960
You can define the period of time by using a lifecycle policy.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,820
Using the industry accepted estimate that 20% of data is actively used

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,230
and 80% is infrequently accessed,

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,320
you can store your files on EFS

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,840
at an effective price of $0.08 per gigabyte-month.

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,920
Performance modes.

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,160
Amazon EFS offers two performance modes, General Purpose and Max I/O.

20
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,320
General Purpose provides the lowest latency per file system operation

21
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,780
and can achieve this for random or sequential IO patterns.

22
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,860
Max IO can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,660
and is ideal for highly parallelized applications

24
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,940
that can scale up to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances.

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,280
Throughput modes.

26
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,430
The throughput mode helps determine the overall throughput a file system can achieve.

27
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,460
Amazon EFS offers two throughput modes, bursting and provisioned.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,900
With bursting throughput, the throughput scales with the size of the file system.

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,440
Dynamically bursting is needed to support the spiky nature of many file-based workloads.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,360
Provisioned throughput is designed to support applications

31
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,930
that require higher dedicated throughput than the default bursting mode

32
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,660
and can be configured independently of the amount of data stored on the file system.

33
00:02:01,266 --> 00:02:02,530
Encryption.

34
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,940
Amazon EFS offers encryption of data at rest and in transit,

35
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,160
providing a comprehensive encryption solution.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,620
Data at rest is transparently encrypted using encryption keys

37
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,330
managed by the AWS Key Management Service,

38
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,360
AWS KMS, eliminating the need to build and maintain a key management infrastructure.

39
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,020
Encryption of data in transit uses industry-standard transport layer security, or TLS

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,830
to secure network traffic without having to modify your applications.

41
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:34,260
Containers and serverless file storage.

42
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,540
Amazon EFS is integrated with containers and serverless compute services from AWS

43
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,330
that require shared storage for latency-sensitive

44
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,360
and IOPS-heavy workloads at any scale.

45
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,620
In a single step, Amazon EFS provides applications

46
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,830
running on Amazon Elastic Container Service, or ECS,

47
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,733
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, or EKS,

48
00:02:54,733 --> 00:03:00,666
AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda access to shared file systems for stateful workloads.
