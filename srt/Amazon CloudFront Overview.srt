00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Welcome to the Amazon CloudFront Overview.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,230
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network which is fast,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,530
highly secure, and programmable.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,940
Amazon CloudFront allows for the delivery of static

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,000
and dynamic content as well as applications.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,600
The delivery of this content through CloudFront can

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,050
scale to millions of globally distributed concurrent users.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,940
CloudFront's lightning-fast content delivery capabilities

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,820
are achieved through a massively scaled

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,340
and globally distributed network with numerous edge locations,

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,110
also called points of presence.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,250
These points of presence

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,160
which cache content bring cloud services closer than ever to the end user,

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,900
no matter where they are in the world

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,700
or where your main service is hosted.

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,480
Next, we will discuss some of the benefits of using CloudFront.

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,300
The first benefit is fast content delivery.

18
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,390
CloudFront points of presence are interconnected through the AWS Backbone.

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,880
This backbone is fully redundant and built with a parallel,

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,920
high-speed Ethernet fiber network.

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,780
Connection to this AWS network backbone vastly reduces latency,

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,110
effectively increasing customer speeds.

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,440
Moreover, to further decrease latency,

24
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,270
CloudFront uses a multi-tiered caching architecture.

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,260
It also intelligently routes your content to the most

26
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,640
performing edge locations based on your end user needs.

27
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,890
The next benefit is CloudFront's cost-effectiveness.

28
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,670
CloudFront offers personalized pricing options including pay-as-you-go

29
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,990
and custom pricing.

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,310
Pay-as-you-go pricing is simple,

31
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,880
with no up-front fees.

32
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,350
However, for steeper discounts,

33
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,290
consider using custom pricing.

34
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,700
Custom pricing requires minimum traffic commitments

35
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,590
such as 10 terabytes per month.

36
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,180
Custom pricing may also include bundled discounts.

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,440
Customers can see large security service savings of up to 30 percent.

38
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,830
CloudFront also offers origin savings.

39
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,460
Origin fetches are free for content if the origins are

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,160
Simple Storage Service,

41
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,420
Elastic Load Balancing, or Elastic Compute Cloud.

42
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,190
CloudFront also makes use of regional edge caches at no additional cost.

43
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,670
Regional edge caches can reduce the total operational costs and burden.

44
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,640
Another benefit of CloudFront is its integration with AWS.

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,600
CloudFront provides deep integration with AWS services

46
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,840
such as Simple Storage Service,

47
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,390
Elastic Compute Cloud,

48
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,960
Elastic Load Balancing,

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,900
and Elemental media services.

50
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,300
This deep level of integration improves developer and DevOps efficiency.

51
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,780
Developers have a full-featured API to create,

52
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,530
configure, and maintain CloudFront distributions.

53
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,700
In addition, developers have access to a number of developer tools such as

54
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,340
AWS CodeDeploy,

55
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,620
CodeCommit, and AWS SDKs

56
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,790
to configure and deploy their workloads with Amazon CloudFront.

57
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,250
Developers will also have ability to

58
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,950
manage infrastructure with tools like CloudFormation

59
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,410
and can get a host of metrics and logs with CloudWatch integration.
