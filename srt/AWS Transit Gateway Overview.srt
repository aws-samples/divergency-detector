00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,830
AWS Transit Gateway Overview.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,700
AWS Transit Gateway is a managed service that

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,090
helps you connect your Amazon VPCs,

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,550
AWS accounts,

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,120
and on-premises networks through a central hub.

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,250
As you expand globally,

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,710
inter-Region peering connects transit gateways

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,370
together using the AWS global network.

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,850
Your data is automatically encrypted and never travels over the public internet.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,020
Because of its central position,

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,720
AWS Transit Gateway Network Manager

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,990
has a unique view over your entire network,

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,900
even connecting to software-defined wide area network,

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,620
or SD-WAN, devices.

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,760
Here are some key benefits.

16
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,300
Centralized network management.

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,260
Transit Gateway simplifies network management by providing a

18
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,910
single entry point for all connected resources,

19
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,260
eliminating the need to manage multiple VPCs

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,380
and on-premises networks separately.

21
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,550
High scalability.

22
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,720
Transit Gateway can handle millions of routes

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,950
and support up to 5000 VPCs

24
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,280
and on-premises networks for Transit Gateway,

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,440
making it ideal for customers with large and complex network environments.

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,490
Cost-effective.

27
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,830
Customers pay only for the resources they use,

28
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,890
making it a cost-effective solution for networking needs.

29
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,660
It also removes the need to purchase and manage expensive hardware

30
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,430
such as routers and switches,

31
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,540
saving customers money on up-front costs and maintenance.

32
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,920
Here are some key features.

33
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:34,980
Security.

34
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,280
AWS Transit Gateway integrates with Identity and Access Management, or IAM,

35
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,300
and enables you to manage access to AWS Transit Gateway securely.

36
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,820
Using IAM,

37
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,220
you can create and manage

38
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,960
AWS users and groups

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,610
and use permissions to deny and allow their access to the AWS Transit Gateway.

40
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,620
Routing.

41
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,700
AWS Transit Gateway supports dynamic and static layer-3

42
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,970
routing between Amazon VPCs and a VPN.

43
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,730
Routes determine the next hop depending on

44
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,830
the destination IP address of the packet

45
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,550
and can point to an Amazon VPC or to a VPN connection.

46
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,490
SD-WAN compatibility.

47
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,910
Compatible SD-WAN

48
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,200
partners of AWS,

49
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,100
such as Cisco, Aruba, Silver Peak, Aviatrix,

50
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,520
and Versa, have preconfigured AWS site-to-site VPN,

51
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,780
so that SD-WAN solutions can automate

52
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,110
the connection of your remote sites with AWS.

53
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,610
With AWS Transit Gateway Network Manager,

54
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,880
you get a unified view of your network across AWS

55
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,170
and on-premises networks.
