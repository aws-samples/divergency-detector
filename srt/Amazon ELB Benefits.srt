1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) Benefits.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,060
High Availability and Elasticity.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,940
An elastic load balancer is highly available.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,620
Since it automatically distributes traffic

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,190
across your Amazon EC2 instances in a single AZ or multiple AZs,

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,050
it increases the availability and fault tolerance of your applications.

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,100
Capacity is automatically added and removed based on

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,160
the utilization of the underlying application servers.

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,060
ELB is also a fully managed service,

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,580
meaning you can focus on delivering applications

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,900
and not installing fleets of load balancers.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,110
Security.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,000
Elastic Load Balancing works with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,960
or Amazon VPC, to provide robust security

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,620
features including integrated certificate management,

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,840
user authentication, and SSL/TLS decryption.

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,320
Together,

18
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,170
they give you the flexibility to centrally manage TLS

19
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,940
settings and offload CPU-intensive workloads from your applications.

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,550
Application Load Balancer also supports integration with AWS WAF,

21
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,950
the web application firewall service.

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,140
This adds a level of protection before bad actors reach the application.

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,650
Further,

24
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,080
s2n and HTTP Guardian have been developed

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,390
as open-source solutions to reduce the potential for HTTP-based attacks.

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,710
Feature Breadth. Elastic Load Balancing offers the breadth of features needed by

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,160
businesses of all sizes while delivering them in an AWS-native experience.

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,460
Elastic Load Balancing includes support for

29
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,620
features needed in container-based workloads,

30
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,550
including HTTP/2, gRPC,

31
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,780
TLS offload,

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,390
advanced rule-based routing,

33
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,810
and integration with container services as an ingress controller.

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,360
Application Load Balancer

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,830
provides customers with a native HTTP endpoint for calling Lambda functions,

36
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,150
removing the dependency on other solutions.

37
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,250
Further, Gateway Load Balancer creates one gateway for

38
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,070
routing traffic through fleets of third-party appliances.

39
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,250
Robust monitoring and visibility.

40
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,490
Elastic Load Balancing allows you to monitor the health of your

41
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,900
applications and their performance in real time with Amazon CloudWatch metrics,

42
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,690
logging, and request tracing.

43
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,770
This improves visibility into the behavior of your applications,

44
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,420
uncovering issues and identifying performance

45
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,820
bottlenecks in your application stack.

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,160
Elastic Load Balancing helps ensure compliance

47
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,960
with application service-level agreements, or SLAs.

48
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,640
Integration and global reach. As a native AWS service,

49
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,090
Elastic Load Balancing is tightly integrated with other AWS services like

50
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,910
EC2, ECS, EKS, Global Accelerator,

51
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,790
and operational tools such as AWS CloudFormation and AWS Billing.

52
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,120
Across the Amazon global infrastructure and

53
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,770
customer data centers with AWS Outposts

54
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
and on-premises target support,

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,320
ELB is available everywhere you run your AWS workloads.
