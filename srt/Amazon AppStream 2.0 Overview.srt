Image builders

18
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:45,625

called image builders, which AppStream 2.0 provides.

20
00:01:53,125 --> 00:02:03,375
To create your own custom image, you
connect to an image builder instance, install and configure your applications for streaming, and then create your image by creating a snapshot of the image builder instance.

that run the image that you specify.

24
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:23,416
