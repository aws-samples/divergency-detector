00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
Welcome to an Overview of Amazon Polly.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,280
Amazon Polly

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,230
is a service that converts text into lifelike speech,

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,760
allowing you to create applications that talk and

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,790
build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,960
Polly's text-to-speech service uses advanced deep-learning technologies

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,360
to synthesize natural sounding human speech.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,200
With dozens of lifelike voices across a broad set of languages,

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,090
you can build speech-enabled applications that work in many different countries.

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,680
Amazon Polly offers neural text-to-speech voices

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,410
that deliver advanced improvements in speech quality

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,200
through machine-learning technology.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,260
Polly's neural TTS technology also supports a newscaster speaking style

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,850
that is tailored to news narration use cases.

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,360
And finally, with Amazon Polly Brand Voice,

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,150
you can create a custom voice for your organization.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,640
Amazon Polly Brand Voice is a custom engagement

18
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,770
where you will work with the Amazon Polly team

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,690
to build an NTTS voice

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,140
for the exclusive use of your organization.

21
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,580
Let's review some of the benefits of Amazon Polly.

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,530
Store and Redistribute Speech.

23
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,250
Amazon Polly

24
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,020
allows for unlimited replays of generated speech without any additional fees.

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,330
You can create speech files in standard formats like MP3 and OGG

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,340
and serve them from the cloud

27
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,630
or locally

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,990
with apps or devices for offline playback.

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,160
Real-Time Streaming.

30
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,500
With Amazon Polly,

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,830
you can stream information through your application in near real-time.

32
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,850
You can also choose from various sampling rates

33
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,070
to optimize bandwidth and audio quality for your application.

34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,490
Amazon Polly supports MP3, Vorbis,

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,010
and raw PCM audio stream formats.

36
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,290
Customized Output.

37
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,900
Amazon Polly supports Speech Synthesis Markup Language,  or SSML,

38
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:55,940
the W3C standard

39
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,070
XML-based markup language for speech-synthesis applications,

40
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,740
and it supports common SSML tags used for phrasing, emphasis,

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,780
and intonation.

42
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,740
Custom Amazon SSML tags provide unique options,

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,690
such as the ability to control the pitch, volume,

44
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,800
and rate of synthesized speech.

45
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,090
Simple-to-Use API.

46
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,250
Amazon Polly provides an API that enables you

47
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,300
to quickly integrate speech synthesis into your application.

48
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,040
You simply send the text you want converted into speech to the Amazon Polly API,

49
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,900
and Amazon Polly immediately returns the audio stream to your application,

50
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,280
so your application can begin streaming it directly to an audience

51
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,950
or store it in a standard audio-file format.

52
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,220
Let's review some key features of Amazon Polly.

53
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,440
Speech Synchronization.

54
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,740
Amazon Polly makes it easy to request an additional stream of metadata

55
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,520
that provides information about when particular sentences, words,

56
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,150
and sounds are being pronounced.

57
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,220
Using this metadata stream

58
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,930
alongside the synthesized speech audio stream,

59
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,430
you can build your applications with an enhanced visual experience

60
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,110
such as speech-synchronized facial animation or karaoke-style word highlighting.

61
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,950
Custom Lexicons.

62
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,870
With Amazon Polly's custom lexicons or vocabularies,

63
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,700
you can modify the pronunciation of particular words,

64
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,520
such as company names, acronyms, and neologisms like ROTFL,

65
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,910
which means "roll on the floor laughing."

66
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,480
To customize these pronunciations,

67
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,840
you simply upload an XML file with lexical entries.

68
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,890
Speech-Synthesis Options.

69
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,280
Amazon Polly can be accessed via the Polly API,

70
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,260
AWS Management Console,

71
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,640
and the AWS Command Line Interface.

72
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,440
You have full control over all the capabilities of Amazon Polly,

73
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,680
whether you use the service through the console,

74
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,770
the API,

75
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,930
or the CLI.

76
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,980
Amazon Polly also supports the Amazon SDK,

77
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,650
including all AWS SDK programming languages.
