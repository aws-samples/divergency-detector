1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Cloud Computing.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,890
Cloud computing is

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,850
the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,110
resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,400
Whether you are using it to run applications that share photos

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,820
to millions of mobile users or to support business-critical operations,

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,730
a cloud services platform provides rapid access to flexible and low-cost IT resources.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,410
You can access as many resources as you need

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,460
almost instantly and only pay for what you use.

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,550
With cloud computing,

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,530
you don't need to make large up-front investments in hardware and spend

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,580
a lot of time on the heavy lifting of managing that hardware.

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,620
Instead, you can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,450
you need to power your newest idea or operate your IT department.

15
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,660
Benefits of Cloud Computing.

16
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,530
Agility.

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,940
The cloud makes it easy and fast to access a broad-range technology such as compute,

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,900
storage databases, analytics, machine learning,

19
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,330
and many other services on an as-needed basis.

20
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,380
As a result, you can very quickly develop and roll out new

21
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,750
applications, and your teams can experiment

22
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,880
and innovate more quickly and frequently.

23
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,990
If an experiment fails,

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,700
you can always de-provision resources without risk,

25
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,350
lowering the cost of failure and the cost of change.

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,830
We can define agility as the ability to respond

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,930
to learning and changing circumstances quickly and inexpensively.

28
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:42,890
And the risk in a business could be more or less proportional to the lack of agility. Elasticity.

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,100
In the traditional data center-based model,

30
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,550
when you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application,

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,780
you often end up either sitting on

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,310
expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity.

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,890
With cloud computing,

34
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,280
you can provision the amount of resources that you actually need, knowing

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,140
you can instantly scale in or out with the needs of your business.

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,990
This reduces cost and improves the ability to meet your user's demands.

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,330
Cost Savings. Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure

38
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,600
capacity needs. No more expensive idle resources.

39
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,930
You pay only for how much you consume.

40
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,210
Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers

41
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,300
rather than on the heavy lifting of racking,

42
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,950
stacking, and powering servers. Also,

43
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,900
you don't need to invest heavily in data centers and

44
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,110
servers before you know how you're going to use them.

45
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,830
Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud,

46
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,800
providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale,

47
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,510
which translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices.

48
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,760
Deployed globally in minutes.

49
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,400
With a cloud,

50
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,190
you can easily deploy your application in multiple physical

51
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,580
locations around the world with just a few clicks.

52
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,650
This means you can provide a lower-latency and

53
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,190
better experience for your customers simply and at minimal cost.
