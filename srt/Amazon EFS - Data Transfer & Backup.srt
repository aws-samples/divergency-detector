1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) Data Transfer and Backup.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:11,110
Moving your Amazon EFS file data can be managed simply with AWS DataSync.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,580
AWS DataSync is a managed data transfer service that

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,360
simplifies, automates, and accelerates copying data between NFS file shares,

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,430
EFS file systems, S3 buckets, and on-premises storage.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,630
AWS DataSync can transfer your file data and also

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,170
file system metadata such as ownership, timestamps, and access permissions.

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,790
AWS DataSync uses a software agent to connect to your EFS file systems.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,440
It automates scaling and validating transfers.

10
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,950
So you don't have to write scripts,

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,930
modify your applications, or manage infrastructure.

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,300
You can transfer active datasets over AWS Direct Connect or the internet

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,180
at speeds up to 10 times faster than open-source tools.

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,350
You can use the service for one-time data migrations,

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,480
ongoing workflows with periodic synchronization, and

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,800
replication for data protection and recovery.

17
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,220
AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service

18
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,240
that makes it easy to centrally manage and

19
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,170
automate backups of your Amazon EFS file systems,

20
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,890
removing the need for costly custom solutions.

21
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,440
AWS Backup goes beyond backing up Amazon EFS

22
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,770
and centralizes the backup of data across other AWS services in the cloud

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,190
as well as on premises.

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,290
You do not need to perform backup tasks

25
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,300
service by service,

26
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,190
create custom scripts and manual processes for the backup activities.

27
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,760
Using AWS Backup, you can centrally configure and audit AWS resources,

28
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,520
automate backup scheduling, set retention policies, and monitor backup activity.
