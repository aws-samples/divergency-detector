00:00:00,119 --> 00:00:01,899
Amazon Personalize overview.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,179
Amazon Personalize is a machine learning service

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,039
that generates item recommendations for your users

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,489
primarily based on data gathered when users interact with items in your catalog.

5
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,790
This data can come from historical bulk interaction records

6
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:22,829
in a CSV file and from real time user interactions.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,930
Common use cases for Amazon Personalize include 

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,069
adding product recommendations to an

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,010
e-commerce app,

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,369
segmenting users based on preferences

11
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:37,270
such as product category and brand,

12
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:41,459
and personalizing video recommendations to a streaming app.

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,590
To get started - step one, create a dataset group.

14
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,459
A dataset group is a container for Amazon Personalize resources.

15
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,330
Dataset groups come in two types.

16
00:00:55,209 --> 00:00:59,099
A domain dataset group creates resources for a specific use case,

17
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,709
such as a streaming video

18
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:03,790
or an e-commerce application.

19
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:09,418
A custom dataset group includes custom resources for custom use cases

20
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:11,589
based on your business needs.

21
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,849
Step two - import data to Amazon Personalize.

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,160
Data can be imported in bulk, individually, or both.

23
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:26,650
Bulk data can be prepared and imported by using Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,059
or from a CSV file stored in Amazon's simple storage service.

25
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:34,220
Individual records can be imported through

26
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,540
the Amazon Personalize console and API operations

27
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,449
or interactions data from live events can be imported in real time.

28
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,120
Step three - create recommenders or custom resources.

29
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:52,199
A recommender is a resource in a domain dataset group.

30
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:55,650
The recommenders use machine learning models trained

31
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,819
by Amazon personalize to generate recommendations.

32
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,470
Custom resources are resources in a custom dataset group.

33
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:08,729
Custom resources include a solution, solution version, and campaign.

34
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:12,748
A solution includes an Amazon Personalize recipe,

35
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:16,089
customized parameters, and one or more solution versions.

36
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,190
Solution version is a trained machine

37
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,630
learning model that generates recommendations.

38
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,020
Finally, a campaign deploys a solution version for real-time recommendations.

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,729
Step four - get recommendations

40
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:35,350
Recommenders in a domain dataset group and custom resources

41
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,830
in a custom dataset group support real-time recommendations.

42
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:40,520
However,

43
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:42,940
batch recommendation can only be generated by

44
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:45,490
custom resources in a custom dataset group. 

45
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,279
Custom resources and imported data should be kept up

46
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:52,089
to date to maintain the relevance of recommendations.

47
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,639
This is the end of Amazon Personalize overview.

48
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,059
Thanks for watching.
