00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,670
Here are some benefits from using AWS CodeStar.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,190
With AWS CodeStar, it's easy to start developing in minutes.

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,490
You can choose from a variety of CodeStar templates such as

00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:06,000
Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

21
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,690
For source control,

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,990
you can choose AWS CodeCommit or GitHub for your project, and you can

23
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,130
edit your source code using AWS Cloud9, Microsoft Visual Studio, or Eclipse.

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,970
After you make your selections,

25
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,120
the underlying AWS services are provisioned in minutes,

26
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,600
allowing you to quickly start coding and deploying your applications.

27
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,330
CodeStar provides an easy way to coordinate your day-to-day

28
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,720
development activities through a unified user interface.

29
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,640
AWS CodeStar's project dashboard

30
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,950
lets you monitor code commits,

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,420
builds, tests, and deployments from a central place.

32
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,640
CodeStar also integrates with Atlassian Jira software,

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,390
a third-party issue tracking and

34
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,150
project management tool, allowing you to easily manage

35
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,430
Jira issues directly in the AWS CodeStar dashboard.

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,220
AWS CodeStar also enables you to collaborate on

37
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,490
projects across your team in a secure manner.

38
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,290
You can easily manage access for project owners,

39
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,080
contributors, and viewers without needing to manually

40
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,340
configure your own policy for each service.

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,060
CodeStar simplifies the process of setting up

42
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,190
project access for teams by providing

43
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,430
built-in role-based policies that follow

44
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,670
AWS Identity and Access Management best practices.

45
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,660
AWS CodeStar accelerates software release by integrating AWS CodeBuild,

46
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,600
AWS CodePipeline, and AWS CodeDeploy into the CodeStar service.

47
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,240
Each project comes preconfigured with an automated pipeline that

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,730
continuously builds, tests, and deploys your code with each commit.

49
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,390
And with CodeStar's IDE integrations,

50
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,260
you can begin developing your code directly using AWS Cloud9,

51
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,890
that comes with a pre-authenticated AWS Command Line Interface.

52
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,620
Once your application is deployed, you can monitor its performance with

53
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,910
Amazon CloudWatch or Atlassian Jira.
