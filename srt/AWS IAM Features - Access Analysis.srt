1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
AWS Identity and Access Management Features - Access Analysis.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,000
IAM Access Analyzer generates comprehensive findings that identify resources

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,300
that can be accessed from outside an AWS account.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,775
It evaluates resource policies using mathematical logic and inference

5
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:21,420
to determine the possible access paths allowed by the policies.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,880
IAM Access Analyzer continuously monitors for new or updated policies,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,750
and it analyzes permissions granted,

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,640
using policies for your Amazon S3 buckets,

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,570
AWS KMS keys,

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,360
Amazon SQS queues,

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,210
AWS IAM roles, and AWS Lambda functions.

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,850
IAM provides you service-last-accessed data, which is a timestamp

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,690
on when an IAM policy or entity, such as a user or role,

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,880
last used a service.

15
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,500
From the AWS Organizations master account,

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,800
you can also see the service last accessed by the organization

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,350
root, organizational units, and accounts.

18
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,220
Here are the key benefits.

19
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,360
Saves time analyzing resource policies

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,680
for public or cross-account accessibility.

21
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,760
Compared to heuristics or pattern-matching techniques

22
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,260
that could take days or weeks,

23
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,150
IAM Access Analyzer can quickly analyze

24
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,630
thousands of resource policies in seconds,

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,690
thus saving time.

26
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,710
It delivers detailed findings through the AWS IAM, Amazon S3,

27
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,800
and AWS Security Hub consoles, and also through its APIs.

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,690
Continuously monitors and helps you refine permissions.

29
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,700
IAM Access Analyzer continuously monitors and analyzes

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,075
any new or updated resource policy

31
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:40,970
to help you understand the potential security implications.

32
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,650
In addition, with the service-last-accessed timestamp data,

33
00:01:44,675 --> 00:01:47,920
you can easily identify and remove unused permissions

34
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,560
to improve your security posture by granting only

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,660
the permissions required to perform a specific task.

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,120
Provides the highest levels of security assurance.

37
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,070
IAM Access Analyzer uses automated reasoning

38
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:05,690
to comprehensively summarize which resources grant public or cross-account access.

39
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,160
We call these analytical results "provable security,"

40
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,570
a higher level of assurance for security of the cloud and in the cloud.

41
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,440
This is how it works. First, create an IAM Access Analyzer for your account.

42
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,430
The analyzer will continuously scan supported

43
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,840
resource policies within the account,

44
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,770
then review the detailed findings for resources

45
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,790
that are accessible from outside the AWS account.

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,390
Next, take action.

47
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,210
If access to the resource is not intended,

48
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,040
modify the resource policy

49
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,590
to further restrict access.

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,190
If the access to the resource is intended, then you can archive the finding.
