00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Welcome to the AWS Config Overview.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,500
AWS Config is a service

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,970
that enables you

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,700
to assess, audit,

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,000
and evaluate

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,200
the configurations of your AWS resources.

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,590
Config continuously monitors

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,880
and records

9
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,840
your AWS resource configurations.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,810
This allows you to automate the ongoing evaluation

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,540
of recorded configurations against desired configurations.

12
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:37,190
AWS Config enables you to simplify compliance auditing, change management,

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,850
security analysis,

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,870
and operational troubleshooting.

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,360
Let's look at some benefits of

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,610
AWS Config.

17
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,910
Continuous monitoring.

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,060
AWS Config creates a resource inventory of your AWS resources, including

19
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,040
EC2 software configurations.

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,520
After the initial resource discovery,

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,780
new resources are added automatically with

22
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,170
continuous monitoring when configuration changes occur.

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,170
Amazon SNS

24
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,870
can send notifications, so you can review or take action to modify the change.

25
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,140
Continuous assessment.

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,430
By creating rules that

27
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,910
define your desired resource configuration,

28
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:28,140
you can measure resource compliance against your organization's best practices.

29
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,360
You can package your rules together with corrective actions

30
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,140
into conformance packs.

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,260
Conformance packs can be deployed across your entire organization.

32
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,440
Deviations against the rules trigger

33
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,520
SNS notifications

34
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,160
and EventBridge events

35
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,740
for continual alerting.

36
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,630
You can measure your overall compliance

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,880
and easily find non-compliant resources

38
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,020
Change management.

39
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,690
The configuration history allows you to view any configuration

40
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,530
point in the past for a specific resource.

41
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,270
You can easily view relationships

42
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,449
and resource dependencies.

43
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,760
This allows you to understand the impact of

44
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,500
potential changes before you make the change.

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,890
This helps to minimize change-related incidents.

46
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,420
Operational troubleshooting.

47
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,610
You can identify the root cause of operational issues

48
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,350
through AWS Config's integration with AWS CloudTrail.

49
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,200
CloudTrail correlates configuration changes to

50
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,910
particular events in your account.

51
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,020
This allows you to view

52
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,040
the details of an event API call

53
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,630
that invoked the change, such as who made the request,

54
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,160
at what time,

55
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,980
and from which IP address.

56
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,500
Enterprise-wide compliance.

57
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,300
With multi-account and multi-region data aggregation,

58
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,870
you can view compliance status

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,710
across your enterprise from a central account.

60
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,240
This allows you to identify non-compliant accounts.

61
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:14,030
You can dive deeper into status for a specific region or a specific account.

62
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,640
Third-party resource support.

63
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,640
With AWS Config can perform configuration audit and compliance verification

64
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,870
of both your AWS

65
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,050
and third-party resources.

66
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,690
You can publish the configuration of third-party resources,

67
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,870
such as GitHub repositories,

68
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,750
Microsoft Active Directory resources, or any on-premises server into AWS.

69
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,670
You can then view and monitor

70
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,200
the resource inventory

71
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,320
and configuration history.

72
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,190
You can also create

73
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,750
AWS config rules and conformance packs

74
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,810
to evaluate these third-party resources.
