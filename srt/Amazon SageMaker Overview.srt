00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to an Overview of Amazon SageMaker.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,600
Amazon SageMaker

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,400
is a fully managed service

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,050
that provides developers and data scientists

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,130
with the ability to collect and prepare,

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,240
build, train,

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,950
and deploy machine-learning models quickly.

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,850
Amazon SageMaker

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,510
removes the heavy lifting from each step of the machine-learning process

10
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,240
to make it easier to develop high-quality models.

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,940
Amazon SageMaker

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,910
provides all of the components used for machine learning

13
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,170
in a single toolset,

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,600
so models get to production faster

15
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,940
with much less effort

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,700
and at a lower cost.

17
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,060
Here are some of the benefits of using Amazon SageMaker.

18
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,070
Make machine learning more accessible.

19
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,210
With Amazon SageMaker,

20
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,610
machine learning becomes more accessible, enabling people to innovate with ML,

21
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,770
through a choice of tools,

22
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,670
an integrated IDE,

23
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,140
and no-code visual interfaces.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,790
Prepare data at scale.

25
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,590
With Amazon SageMaker, you can access, label,

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,600
and process large amounts of structured data like tabular data from spreadsheets

27
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,640
and unstructured data like photos, video,

28
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,960
and audio.

29
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,250
Accelerate ML development.

30
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,180
With Amazon SageMaker,

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,770
you can reduce training time from hours to minutes

32
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,540
with an optimized infrastructure,

33
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,510
and you can boost productivity

34
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,210
with purpose-built tools.

35
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,480
Amazon SageMaker also enables you to automate

36
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,660
and standardize MLOps practices across your organization,

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,290
allowing you to train and deploy models at scale.

38
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,010
Amazon SageMaker can be utilized for specific use cases as well.

39
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,100
With Amazon SageMaker Canvas, business analysts can easily prepare data,

40
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,680
train models,

41
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,200
and generate predictions using a point-and-click interface.

42
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,240
They can then share the results with data scientists

43
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,350
and integrate them into common business intelligence tools.

44
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,320
With Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebook,

45
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:09,120
data scientists can access data from structured and unstructured data sources,

46
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,300
improve productivity with purpose-built tools

47
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,690
and fully managed Jupyter notebooks with just a few clicks.

48
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,340
And with Amazon SageMaker MLOps,

49
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,320
software developers can build CI/CD pipelines to reduce model management overhead,

50
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,660
automate ML workflows to accelerate data preparation and model building, training,

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,310
and experiments.

52
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,420
It can also monitor ML model quality by automatically detecting bias and drift,

53
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,670
and automatically track code datasets and artifacts

54
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,720
at each step of the ML lifecycle.
