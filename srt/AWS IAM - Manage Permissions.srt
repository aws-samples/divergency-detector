1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
AWS Identity and Access Management Features - Manage IAM Permissions.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,360
Permissions are granted to IAM entities including IAM users,

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,300
federated users, groups, and roles.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,080
To give entities permissions, you can attach a policy.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,650
A policy consists of one or more statements,

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,320
each of which describes one set of permissions.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,500
Versions specify the version of the policy language

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,740
that you want to use.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,810
Sid is optional and specifies the statement ID

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,980
to differentiate between your statements.

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,640
Effect specifies whether to allow or deny access.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,920
Because access is denied by default,

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,890
you typically write policies where the effect is to allow.

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,680
Principal specifies the IAM entity that is allowed or denied access to a resource.

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,520
Action includes a list of actions that you allow or deny.

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,920
And here are some action examples for S3 service.

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,450
Resources specify which AWS resources you allow the action on.

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,860
Conditions specify which conditions must be present for the policy to take effect.

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,030
For example, you might allow access only to specific S3 buckets

20
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,060
if the user is connecting from a specific IP range,

21
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,030
or has used multi-factor authentication at login.

22
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,460
You create policies by using either the visual editor or JSON.

23
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,670
The visual editor guides you through granting permissions by using

24
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,970
IAM policies without having to write the JSON syntax.

25
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,310
You simply choose the service, actions,

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,030
resources, and request conditions to generate your policy.

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,760
You can still author and edit policies in JSON, if preferred.

28
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,650
The following policy example was created with the visual editor.

29
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,420
This policy is for Amazon S3 service.

30
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,740
It grants four list actions and one read action to the S3 bucket and objects in SampleBucket

31
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,780
if the prefix starts with MyPrefix.

32
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,650
To make it simpler to choose AWS service's actions,

33
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,910
they are categorized in these access levels: list, read, tagging,

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,580
write, and permissions management.

35
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,380
If you use the AWS Management Console to manage permissions,

36
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,030
you can view policy summaries.

37
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,280
A policy summary lists the access level, resources,

38
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,940
and conditions for each service defined in a policy.
