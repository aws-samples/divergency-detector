Hello and welcome to AWS Well-Architected Overview.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,880
AWS Well-Architected helps cloud architects design infrastructure

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,060
that is built around six pillars, operational excellence,

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:18,798
security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,530
The AWS Well-Architected framework includes hands-on labs,

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,000
access to the AWS Well-Architected Partner Program,

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,020
and the AWS Well-Architected tool which architects can use to evaluate workloads,

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,840
identify high-risk issues,

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,260
and record improvements.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,880
Let us take a closer look at the six pillars that define an

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:38,890
AWS Well-Architected design.
Let us take a closer look at the six pillars that define an

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,970
AWS Well-Architected design.

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,740
The Operational excellence pillar focuses on running and

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:49,060
monitoring systems and continually improving processes and procedures.

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,460
The Security pillar focuses on protecting information and systems.

16
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,250
The Reliability pillar focuses on ensuring workloads perform their assigned

17
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,990
functions and recover quickly from any failure to meet demands.

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,200
The Performance efficiency pillar focuses on

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,960
selecting suitable resource types and sizes,

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,980
monitoring performance, and maintaining efficiency.

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,670
The Cost optimization pillar focuses on understanding spending trends,

22
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,310
controlling fund allocation,

23
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,160
and scaling to meet business needs without overspending.

24
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,800
The Sustainability pillar focuses on minimizing the

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,540
environmental impact of running your cloud workloads,

26
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,170
such as energy consumption and resource use.

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,180
How does the AWS Well-Architected tool help

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,250
create a Well-Architected infrastructure?

29
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,600
The AWS Well-Architected tool extends the Well-Architected functionality,

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,700
best practices, measurements,

31
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,870
and learnings into your existing architecture processes, applications, and workflows.

32
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,150
It creates custom lenses where you can add best-practices

33
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,820
pillars and questions based on what's most important to your organization.

34
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,910
Using the tool,

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,960
you can share your workloads and custom lenses with up to 300 individual

36
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,360
AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM,

37
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,600
users or accounts or across an entire organization.

38
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,110
Reviewing your workload against sustainability

39
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,930
best practices in the AWS Well-Architected tool

40
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,840
can help you understand energy consumption and environmental impact.

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,378
The AWS Well-Architected tool is available in the AWS GovCloud Region of the US.

42
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,690
So customers with specific regulatory and

43
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,060
compliance requirements can conduct self-service

44
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,490
public sector reviews.

45
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,660
You can learn more about the AWS Well-Architected tool and custom lenses

46
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,980
