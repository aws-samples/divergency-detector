Responsive real-time analytics.

26
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,900
Responsive real-time analytics applications send real-time

27
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,230
alarms or notifications when certain metrics reach predefined

28
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,140
thresholds, or in more advanced cases when your

29
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,820
application detects anomalies using machine-learning algorithms.

30
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,940
Interactive analysis of data streams.

31
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,710
Interactive analysis makes streaming data exploration in real time possible.

32
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,020
With on-demand queries or programs,

33
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,300
you can inspect streams from Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka or

34
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,750

process streaming data in real time.

46
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,300
You write application code in a language supported by Apache Flink

47
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,750
to process the incoming streaming data and produce output.

48
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,120
Then Kinesis Data Analytics writes the output to a configured destination.
