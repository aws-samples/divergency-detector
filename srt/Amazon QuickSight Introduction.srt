Introduction

3
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:11,708
Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-scale
business intelligence service that you can use to deliver easy-to-understand insights to the people who you work with, wherever they are.

4
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:17,885
In a single data dashboard, QuickSight can
include data from AWS, third-party sources,

5
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:24,445
big data sources, spreadsheets,
software-as-a-service sources, business-to-business sources, and more.

6
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:31,416
A dashboard is the published version of an
analysis that you can share with other users of QuickSight for reporting purposes.

7
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:38,916
A data analysis is the basic workspace for
creating data visualizations, which are graphical representations of your data.

8
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:44,156
QuickSight uses a superfast parallel
in-memory calculation engine, called SPICE.

9
00:00:44,156 --> 00:00:51,156
The storage and processing capacity
available in SPICE speeds up the analytical queries that you run against your imported data.

10
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:58,196
By using SPICE, you save time because you
don't need to retrieve the data every time you change an analysis, or update a visual.

11
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,743

which means no more over-provisioning for
peak usage or requirements for thousands of end-user licenses.
