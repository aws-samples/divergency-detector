00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,780
Amazon CloudWatch Overview.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,540
Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,270
built for DevOps engineers,

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,520
developers, site reliability engineers, and IT managers.

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,580
CloudWatch provides you with data and

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,230
actionable insights to monitor your applications,

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,610
respond to system-wide performance changes,

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,660
optimize resource utilization,

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,130
and get a unified view of operational health.

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,900
CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,620
in the form of logs, metrics, and events,

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,770
providing you with a unified view of AWS resources,

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,800
applications, and services

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,340
that run on AWS and on-premises servers.

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,370
You can use CloudWatch to detect anomalous behavior in your environments.

16
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,600
set alarms, visualize logs

17
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,450
and metrics side by side, take automated actions,

18
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,900
troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to

19
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,690
keep your applications running smoothly.

20
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,920
Here are some benefits of Amazon CloudWatch.

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,430
Amazon CloudWatch enables observability on a

22
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,260
single platform across applications and infrastructure.

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,410
Modern applications running on microservices architectures

24
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,360
generate large volumes of data in the form of metrics,

25
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,560
logs, and events.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,900
Amazon CloudWatch enables you to collect, access,

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,400
and correlate this data on a single platform from

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,160
across all your AWS resources, applications, and services

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,130
that run on AWS and on-premises servers.

30
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,180
Amazon CloudWatch makes it easy

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,740
to collect metrics in AWS and on premises.

32
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,900
It natively integrates with more than 70 AWS

33
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,600
services such as Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB,

34
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,700
and automatically publishes detailed 1-minute metrics and

35
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,070
custom metrics with up to 1 sec granularity,

36
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,030
so you can dive deep into your logs for additional context.

37
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,690
You can also use CloudWatch and hybrid cloud

38
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,760
architectures by using the CloudWatch agent or

39
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,170
API to monitor your on-premises resources.

40
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,440
Amazon CloudWatch also helps you improve

41
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,270
operational performance and resource optimization.

42
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,580
With CloudWatch,

43
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,810
you can set alarms and automate actions based

44
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,000
on predefined thresholds or machine-learning algorithms.

45
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,100
For instance,

46
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,260
it can start Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically

47
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,800
or stop an instance to reduce billing overages.

48
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,660
You can also use CloudWatch Events for Serverless

49
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,560
to trigger workflows with services like AWS Lambda

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,270
and Amazon SNS.

51
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,440
And finally, to get operational visibility

52
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,570
and derive actionable insights from logs,

53
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,210
CloudWatch provides automatic dashboards,

54
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,740
data with 1-second granularity, and up to 15 months of metrics,

55
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,920
storage, and retention.

56
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,680
You can also perform metric math to gain insights,

57
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,770
such as aggregating usage across an entire fleet of

58
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,230
EC2 instances. You can also explore, analyze, and visualize your logs,

59
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,440
so you can troubleshoot operational problems.

60
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,620
And with CloudWatch Logs Insights,

61
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,580
you only pay for the queries you run.

62
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,820
You can then publish your metrics and logs

63
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,540
together in CloudWatch dashboards for complete operational visibility.
