00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,210
Amazon Relational Database Service

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,200
(Amazon RDS) Overview.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,710
Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,390
Amazon RDS makes it easy to set up,

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,540
operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,050
It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,480
automating time-consuming administration tasks

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,040
such as hardware provisioning,

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,640
database setup, patching, and backups.

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,970
It frees you to focus on your applications.

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,330
Amazon RDS provides you with six familiar database engines to choose from,

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,040
including Amazon Aurora,

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,220
PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle Database, and SQL Server.

14
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,020
You can use the AWS Database Migration Service to

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,540
easily migrate or replicate your existing databases to Amazon RDS.

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,330
Here are the key benefits.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,340
Easy to administer.

18
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,400
Amazon RDS makes it easy

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,710
to go from project conception to deployment.

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,600
You can use the Amazon RDS Management Console,

21
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,840
the AWS RDS Command Line Interface, or simple API calls to

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,870
access the capabilities of a production-ready relational database in minutes.

23
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,040
You do not need to worry about infrastructure provisioning,

24
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,920
installing, and maintaining database software.

25
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,430
Highly scalable.

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,580
You can vertically scale your databases,

27
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,640
compute, memory, and storage resources

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,730
with only a few mouse clicks or an API call,

29
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,660
often with no downtime.

30
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,470
Many Amazon RDS engine types allow you to

31
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,340
launch one or more read replicas to offload

32
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,770
read traffic from your primary database instance.

33
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,020
Amazon RDS runs on the same

34
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,870
highly reliable infrastructure used by other Amazon web services.

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,680
When you provision a Multi-AZ DB instance,

36
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,810
Amazon RDS synchronously replicates the data to a

37
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,310
standby instance in a different Availability Zone, or AZ.

38
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,460
Amazon RDS also has many other features

39
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,650
that enhance reliability for critical production databases,

40
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,280
including automated backups,

41
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,670
database snapshots,

42
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,390
and automatic host replacement.

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,570
Fast. A DB instance is an isolated database environment running in the cloud.

44
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,390
You can provision new RDS instances only in a few minutes.

45
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,020
Amazon RDS supports the most demanding

46
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,670
database applications with fast performance.

47
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,280
You can choose between two SSD-backed storage options.

48
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,200
In addition,

49
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,120
Amazon Aurora provides performance on par

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,780
with commercial databases at one-tenth the cost.

51
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,460
Secure.

52
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,900
Amazon RDS makes it easy to control network access to your database.

53
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,140
It lets you isolate your database instances by running

54
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,010
them on Amazon VPC and connect to your existing

55
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,110
IT infrastructure through an industry-standard encrypted IPsec VPN.

56
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,630
Many Amazon RDS engine types also offer

57
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,970
encryption at rest and encryption in transit.
