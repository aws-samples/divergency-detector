00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to a brief lesson on AWS VPN services.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,980
AWS VPN is comprised of two

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,420
highly available, fully managed, and elastic VPN services:

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,800
they are AWS Client VPN and AWS Site-to-Site VPN.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,760
AWS Client VPN is a fully managed remote-access VPN solution

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,680
used by your remote workforce to securely access resources within both AWS

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,280
and your on-premises network.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,190
It is fully elastic and automatically scales up or down based on demand.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,300
So there is no need to manage VPN hardware or software.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,240
AWS Site-to-Site VPN is a fully managed service

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,160
that creates a secure connection between your data center or branch office

12
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:50,950
and your AWS resources using IPsec tunnels.

13
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:53,560
When using Site-to-Site VPN,

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,320
you can connect to both your Amazon VPC as well as AWS Transit Gateway

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,360
and also two tunnels for connection are used for increased redundancy.

16
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,240
Use the accelerated Site-to-Site VPN option to provide better performance

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,090
by working with AWS Global Accelerator

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,300
to intelligently route your traffic when using globally distributed applications.

19
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,160
Now, let's take a look at the AWS Site-to-Site VPN features.

20
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,060
Let's start with high availability.

21
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,260
The AWS Site-to-Site VPN delivers high availability

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,340
by using two tunnels across multiple Availability Zones

23
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,360
within the AWS Global Network.

24
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,620
You can stream primary traffic through the first tunnel

25
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,190
and use the second tunnel for redundancy.

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,440
If one tunnel goes down, traffic continues to flow.

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,040
Next is secure connectivity.

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,040
AWS Site-to-Site VPN uses OpenVPN

29
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,100
which utilizes a TLS-encrypted control channel

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,480
to negotiate the data channel parameters.

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,040
The data channel is SSL-based

32
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,760
but adds additional safeguards such as

33
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,860
hash-based message authentication code, or HMAC,

34
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,940
hashing, and X.509 certificates.

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,420
Robust monitoring about your Site-to-Site VPN

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
is available with CloudWatch to provide you with greater visibility

37
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,360
with robust metrics and custom metrics.

38
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,800
With CloudWatch, you can send your own custom metrics

39
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,950
and add data points in any order and at any rate you choose.

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,020
From there, you can retrieve statistics about those data points

41
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,420
as an ordered set of time-series data.

42
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,780
AWS Site-to-Site VPN offers customizable tunnel options

43
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,200
including inside-tunnel IP address, pre-shared key,

44
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,020
and Border Gateway Protocol Autonomous System Number, or BGP ASN.

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,980
In this way you can set up multiple secure VPN tunnels

46
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,890
to increase the bandwidth for your applications or for resiliency.

47
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,780
You can also set up Equal-Cost Multi-Path routing

48
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,580
or ECMP, using AWS Transit Gateway.

49
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,460
Now, let's review the AWS Client VPN features.

50
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,520
AWS Client VPN is fully managed

51
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,940
so it automatically takes care of deployment,

52
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,660
capacity provisioning, and service updates.

53
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,800
This allows you to monitor all connections from a single console.

54
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,980
For authentication, AWS Client VPN

55
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,180
will use either Active Directory or certificates.

56
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,080
Client VPN integrates with AWS Directory Services

57
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,060
which connects to your existing on-premises Active Directory.

58
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,440
So it does not require you to replicate data

59
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,230
from your existing Active Directory to the cloud.

60
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,260
Certificate-based authentication with Client VPN

61
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,920
integrates with AWS Certificate Manager

62
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,400
to easily provision, manage, and deploy certificates.

63
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,240
For authorization, AWS Client VPN is network-based

64
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,680
so you can define access control rules

65
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,760
that limit access to specific networks based on Active Directory groups.

66
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,020
For connection management, use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor,

67
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,260
store, and access your log files

68
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,020
from AWS Client VPN connection logs.

69
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,060
You can then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs

70
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,880
to monitor, conduct forensics analysis,

71
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,580
and terminate specific connections.
