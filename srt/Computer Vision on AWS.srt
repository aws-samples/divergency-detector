00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,510
Welcome to an Overview

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,700
of Computer Vision on AWS.

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:09,960
Computer vision allows machines to identify people, places, and things in images

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,010
with accuracy at or above human levels with much greater speed and efficiency.

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,390
Often built with deep-learning models,

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,740
it automates extraction, analysis,

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,700
classification, and understanding of useful information

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,200
from a single image or a sequence of images.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,320
The image data can take many forms, such as single images, video sequences,

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,630
views from multiple cameras, or three-dimensional data.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,570
Let's review some common use cases

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,730
for computer vision.

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,570
For public safety and home security,

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,580
facial recognition helps you quickly identify unlawful entries

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,940
or persons of interest, resulting in safer communities

16
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,500
and a more effective way of deterring crimes.

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,400
For medical imaging, analysis with computer

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,470
vision can greatly improve the accuracy and speed

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,200
of a patient's medical diagnosis, resulting in better treatment.

20
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,920
In manufacturing,

21
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,820
computer vision can be integrated into robotics

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,720
to enhance the quality assurance

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,230
and operational excellence

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,190
of manufacturing applications,

25
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,590
resulting in reliable,

26
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,130
cost-effective products.

27
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,270
For content management and analysis,

28
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,280
you can deploy metadata extraction

29
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,460
and image classification computer-vision models to millions of images

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,240
in order to improve efficiency

31
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,510
and identify revenue opportunities.

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,840
Now, let's review some of the

33
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,790
AWS computer-vision services.
