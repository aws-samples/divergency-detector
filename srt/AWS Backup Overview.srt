00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,150
Welcome to the AWS Backup Overview.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,920
AWS Backup enables you to centralize and automate data protection

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,740
across many supported AWS services.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,940
AWS Backup currently supports supplying backup policies

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,000
and schedules across your storage, compute, and database resources.

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,980
AWS Backup offers a cost-effective, fully managed

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,410
policy-based service that further simplifies data protection.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,990
The service scales to support your business and growing storage requirements.

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,940
AWS Backup also helps you support your regulatory

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,690
compliance or business policies for data protection.

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,890
Together with AWS Organizations,

12
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,690
AWS Backup enables you to centrally deploy data protection policies to configure,

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,140
manage, and govern your backup activity

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,830
across all your AWS accounts and resources.

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,520
AWS Backup Benefits.

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,040
Centralized Management.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,830
Using the AWS Backup console,

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,940
application program interfaces, or the AWS command line tool,

19
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,440
quickly configure backup policies to simplify backup management.

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,820
AWS Backup makes it easy to ensure that your application data across

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,910
AWS resources is secure,

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,300
backed up, and protected.

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,280
You can then use those same tools to execute backups, restores,

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,280
and set retention policies across your entire AWS Organization.

25
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,450
Process Automation.

26
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,880
AWS Backup's fully managed

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,390
policy-based solution provides automated backup schedules,

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,890
retention management, and lifecycle management,

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,280
eliminating the need for custom scripts and manual processes,

30
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,070
thereby saving you time and money.

31
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,240
With AWS Backup,

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,650
you can apply backup policies to your AWS resources by simply tagging them,

33
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,690
ensuring you implement your backup strategy across your entire

34
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,200
AWS Organization.

35
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,410
Improved Compliance.

36
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,320
From a centralized console,

37
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,100
enforce your backup policies,

38
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,260
encrypt your backups,

39
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,490
and audit and report on backup activity to help meet your compliance requirements.

40
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,500
Backup policies make it simple to align your backup

41
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,860
strategy with your internal business processes so you can comply with

42
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,410
regulatory requirements.

43
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,410
AWS Backup secures your backups by encrypting your data in transit and at rest.

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,280
Audits and reporting are simplified since

45
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,820
backup activity is consolidated across AWS services.

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,580
AWS Backup adheres to PCI and ISO compliance and is also HIPAA eligible.
