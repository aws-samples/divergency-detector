00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,299
AWS Global Infrastructure Overview.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,780
The AWS Global Infrastructure

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,530
delivers a cloud infrastructure

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,100
companies can depend on,

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,369
no matter their size, changing needs, or challenges.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,819
It is designed and built to deliver the most flexible,

7
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:16,399
reliable,

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:17,329
scalable,

9
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:19,229
and secure cloud computing environment

10
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,670
with the highest quality global network performance available today.

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,579
AWS provides the most extensive global footprint

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,079
to ensure your worldwide customers are served.

13
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,110
You can rapidly expand operations to virtually any region or country.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,459
AWS now spans 69 Availability Zones within 22 geographic Regions around the world.

15
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:44,800
The footprint is expanding continuously,

16
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,700
with plans for 13 more Availability Zones,

17
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,799
and four more AWS Regions in Indonesia, Italy, South Africa and Spain.

18
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:57,060
This fast-paced expansion of Regions is also paired with

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,659
Amazon's long-term commitment to a sustainable future

20
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,639
using renewable energy sources.

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,610
The AWS Global Infrastructure consists of the following main components.

22
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:13,239
Amazon Cloud computing resources are hosted in multiple worldwide locations

23
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,269
referred to as AWS Regions.

24
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:17,260
Each AWS Region

25
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,910
is a separate geographic area

26
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:22,830
and has multiple isolated locations, known as Availability Zones.

27
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:25,089
An AWS Region

28
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:26,760
has at least two Availability Zones,

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,860
most have three,

30
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,000
including all new Regions, and several have as many as six.

31
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:33,880
They are fully isolated

32
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,529
and are many kilometers apart from each other

33
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,029
for complete redundancy.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,550
Each Availability Zone consists of one or more discrete data centers,

35
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:43,760
typically three,

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,330
and at full scale, it can be hundreds of thousands of servers.

37
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,379
To ensure maximum reliability,

38
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:51,349
each data center has redundant power,

39
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:53,500
dedicated Metro Fiber connectivity,

40
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,180
and are housed in separate facilities.

41
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,199
Network.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,720
Every data center, AZ, and AWS Region

43
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,339
is interconnected via a purpose-built, highly available

44
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:07,970
and low-latency, private global network infrastructure.

45
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:10,720
The network is built on a global,

46
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,899
fully redundant parallel 100 gigabit Ethernet Metro Fiber network.

47
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,119
Points of Presence.

48
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,630
With Amazon CloudFront,

49
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,660
AWS operates the largest global content delivery network, or CDN,

50
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,029
of any cloud provider.

51
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,820
It enables customers to securely deliver customers' data content to end users

52
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,039
with low latency and high transfer speeds,

53
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,870
through a worldwide network of global points of presence, PoP locations,

54
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,270
which consist of edge locations and regional edge cache servers.

55
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,889
Availability Zones make partitioning applications as easy as it can be.

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,289
If an application is partitioned across Availability Zones,

57
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,470
companies are better protected from natural disasters such as lightning strikes,

58
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,020
tornadoes, earthquakes,

59
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,570
and more.

60
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,320
In this example,

61
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,740
you can deploy your application across three Availability Zones,

62
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,869
and a load balancer is used to distribute traffic across them.

63
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:09,750
If one Availability Zone experiences an outage,

64
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,309
traffic is routed to another Availability Zone.

65
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:14,789
Customer application is still up and running.
