Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Overview.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,750
Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, or Amazon Kinesis Firehose,

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,350
provides an easy and reliable way to load streaming data

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,500
to AWS destinations,

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,370
such as data lakes, datastores, and analytics services.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,720
The streaming data can be captured,

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,390
transformed, and delivered to

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,050
Amazon S3,

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,370
Amazon Redshift,

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,860
Amazon OpenSearch Service, and

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,860
third-party service partners such as Datadog,

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,770
New Relic, and Splunk.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,450
It is a fully managed service that automatically scales

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,330
to match the throughput of your data

15
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,480
and eliminates the need for ongoing administration.

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,700
Amazon Kinesis Firehose allows you to configure batching,

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,960
compression, and encryption

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,020
of your data streams before loading,

19
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,510
minimizing the amount of storage used

20
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,290
and maximizing security.

21
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,690
You can easily create a Firehose delivery stream

22
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,150
from the AWS Management Console,

23
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,970
configure it with a few clicks,

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,790
and start ingesting thousands of data streams

25
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,280
to your AWS destinations.

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,890
You can also configure

27
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,380
your data streams to automatically convert

28
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,220
the incoming data to open standard formats,

29
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,450
like Apache Parquet and Apache ORC before the data is delivered.

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,080
Near Real-Time Delivery.

32
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,010
You can specify a batch size or batch

33
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,600
interval to control how quickly data is uploaded

34
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,860
to their cloud destinations.

35
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,600
For example, for new data you can set the

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,540
batch interval to 60 seconds, and the service

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,740
will return processed data within that time frame.

38
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,500
Additionally, you can specify if the data should be compressed.

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,240
This service supports common compression algorithms

40
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,500
including gzip, Hadoop, Zip, and Snappy.
