00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Amazon Kinesis Overview.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,710
Amazon Kinesis makes it easy to collect,

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,460
process, and analyze real-time streaming data,

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,220
So you can get timely insights and react quickly to new information.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,110
Amazon Kinesis offers key capabilities to

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,740
cost-effectively process streaming data at any scale,

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,000
along with the flexibility to choose the tools

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,280
that best suit the requirements of your application.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,290
With Amazon Kinesis, you can ingest real-time data such as video,

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,590
audio, application logs, website clickstreams,

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,400
and IoT telemetry data for machine learning, analytics, and other applications.

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,970
Amazon Kinesis enables you to process and

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,590
analyze data as it arrives and respond instantly,

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,330
instead of having to wait until all your

15
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,810
data is collected before the processing can begin.

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,210
Amazon Kinesis is comprised of four distinct services

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,930
that address numerous use cases for data processing.

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,920
For video, Amazon Kinesis Video Streams

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,920
makes it easy to securely stream video from connected devices to AWS for analytics,

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,960
machine learning, and other processing.

21
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,060
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a scalable

22
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,230
and durable real-time data streaming service,

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,820
that can continuously capture gigabytes of data per

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,940
second from hundreds of thousands of sources.

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,580
Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose

26
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,950
is the easiest way to capture, transform, and load data streams into

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,000
AWS datastores for near

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,250
real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools.

29
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,130
And Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink is the easiest way to process data streams in

30
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,380
real time with SQL or Java, without having to

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,310
learn new programming languages or processing frameworks.

32
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,060
Now let's take a look at a specific use case using Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink

33
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,000
to further demonstrate its capabilities.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,310
To gain insights on user activity for a website,

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,990
clickstream data can be sent to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose,

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,270
which collects the data and sends it to Managed Service for Apache Flink.

37
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,540
From there, Managed Service for Apache Flink will process the clickstream data in real time.

38
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,400
Next,

39
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,870
the processed data can be transferred quickly using

40
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,290
Kinesis Data Firehose directly into Amazon Redshift,

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,430
where analytics models can run and suggest website content recommendations.

42
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,170
As a result, website users will gain more personalized content suggestions.
