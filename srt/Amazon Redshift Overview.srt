00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,800
Amazon Redshift Overview.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,640
Amazon Redshift is a fully managed,

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,160
scalable cloud data warehouse service.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,220
Thousands of customers rely on Amazon Redshift to analyze data

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,340
from terabytes to petabytes,

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,660
and run complex analytical queries.

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,340
Amazon Redshift is natively integrated with

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:21,350
AWS services, database,
Amazon Redshift is natively integrated with

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,590
AWS services, database,

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,410
and machine-learning services.

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,860
It provides efficient storage and optimum query performance

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,200
through a combination of massively parallel processing,

13
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,410
columnar data storage, and data compression encoding schemes.

14
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,420
Now, let's look at the key components of the Amazon Redshift architecture.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,900
Client applications.

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,420
You can connect your client applications to Amazon Redshift clusters

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,440
over Java Database Connectivity, or JDBC,

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,460
Python, and Open Database Connectivity, or ODBC connections.

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,730
A cluster contains one or more compute nodes.

20
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,000
If a cluster has two or more compute nodes,

21
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,040
a leader node

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,660
is used to manage communications between the compute nodes

23
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,350
and client applications.

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,220
The leader node receives queries

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,520
from a client application

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,250
and distributes work to the compute nodes.

27
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,490
Compute nodes perform parallel computing to run queries.

28
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,040
The nodes send intermediate results back to the leader node

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,600
for final aggregation.

30
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,310
A compute node

31
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,170
is partitioned into slices.

32
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,830
The slices work in parallel

33
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,420
to complete an operation.

34
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,120
A cluster contains one or more databases.

35
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,680
Here are the key benefits.

36
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,980
Analyzes all your data.

37
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,890
Amazon Redshift helps break through data silos.

38
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,980
You can get real-time insights and predictive analytics

39
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,960
on all your data across your operational databases,

40
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,400
data lake, data warehouse,

41
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,690
and third-party datasets in just a few clicks.

42
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,280
No data movement or transformation is needed.

43
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,020
Price-performance at any scale.

44
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,430
Using RA3, Amazon Redshift instances,

45
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,200
you can gain up to three times better price-performance

46
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,230
than other cloud data warehouses.

47
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,200
Amazon Redshift can run up to 10 times faster

48
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,810
than other enterprise cloud data warehouses

49
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,060
by using Advanced Query Accelerator, or AQUA,

50
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,820
a distributed and hardware-accelerated cache.

51
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,030
Amazon Redshift Concurrency Scaling

52
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,560
also supports virtually unlimited concurrent users

53
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,000
and concurrent queries.

54
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,880
Streamlined analytics for everyone.

55
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,670
Amazon Redshift Serverless

56
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,580
is a serverless option of Amazon Redshift

57
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,670
that can run and scale analytics in seconds,

58
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,460
without the need to configure

59
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,840
and manage data warehouse infrastructure.

60
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,870
Using query editor version 2,

61
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,060
you can visualize query results in a single click,

62
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,510
create schemas and tables, load data visually,

63
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,790
and browse database objects.

64
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,890
Most secure and compliant.

65
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,240
