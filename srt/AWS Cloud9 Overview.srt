AWS Cloud9 Overview.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,920
AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment, or IDE.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,720
You can write, run, and debug your code with just a browser.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,390
It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,790
Since your Cloud9 IDE

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,700
is cloud-based,

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,760
you can work on your projects from your office,

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,520
home, or anywhere using an internet-connected machine.

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,930
Cloud9 supports over 40 popular programming languages,

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,920
including Node.js, Javascript,

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,240
Python, PHP, Ruby, Go, C++, and more.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,560
AWS Cloud9 also integrates with AWS CodeStar,

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,270
allowing you to quickly set up an end-to-end

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,250
continuous delivery toolchain for your application,

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,060
and start releasing code faster on AWS.

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,860
What are the benefits of Cloud9?

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,380
AWS Cloud9 makes it easy for you to start new projects quickly.

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,780
You do not need to install, configure files,

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,930
SDKs, plug-ins, and match the production

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,490
environment before you can start writing code.

21
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,599
This enables you to start your project within minutes.

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,730
Because Cloud9 is cloud-based,

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,890
you can easily maintain multiple development

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,390
environments to isolate your project's resources.

25
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,750
Another benefit is that you can code with just a browser.

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,220
AWS Cloud9 gives you the flexibility to

27
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,220
run your development environment on a managed Amazon EC2 instance,

28
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,470
or any existing Linux server that supports SSH.

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,400
The Cloud9 code editor and integrated debugger include helpful

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,700
time-saving features, such as code hinting,

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,110
code completion, and step-through debugging.

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,870
Cloud9 terminal provides a browser-based shell experience,

33
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,280
enabling you to install additional software,

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,490
do a git push, or enter commands.

35
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,110
AWS Cloud9 makes collaborating on code easy.

36
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,170
You can code together in real time.

37
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,950
You can share your development environment with your team in just a few clicks.

38
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,440
You can see each other type in real time.

39
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,330
You can also instantly chat with one another from within the IDE.

40
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,900
AWS Cloud9 allows you to quickly run commands

41
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,410
and directly access AWS services.

42
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:12,900
It comes with a terminal that includes sudo privileges to the managed Amazon EC2

43
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,570
instance that is hosting your development environment, and

44
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,560
a pre-authenticated AWS Command Line Interface.

45
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,440
AWS Cloud9 also enables you to build serverless applications with ease.

46
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,610
It preconfigures the development environment with all the SDKs,

47
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,930
libraries, and plug-ins needed for serverless development.

48
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,640
Cloud9 also enables you to easily switch

49
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,770
between local and remote execution of serverless applications.

50
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,240
Cloud9 also provides an environment for

51
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,240
locally testing and debugging AWS Lambda functions.

52
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,760
This allows you to iterate on your code directly,

53
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,630
saving you time and improving the quality of your code.
