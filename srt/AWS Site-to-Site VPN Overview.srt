AWS Site-to-Site VPN Overview

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:06,916
What is AWS Site-to-Site VPN?

3
00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:15,041
AWS Site-to-Site VPN connects your virtual
private clouds, or VPCs, on AWS to your on-premises network.

4
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:20,166
The components of a Site-to-Site VPN
connection include:

5
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:26,250
A secure VPN connection between your
on-premises equipment and your VPCs on AWS.

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,541
An encrypted VPN tunnel, where data can
pass to, or from, AWS.

7
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:37,666
A customer gateway device, which is a
physical or software appliance that handles VPN traffic.

8
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:43,333
A customer gateway to provide information
to AWS about your customer gateway device.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,125
An optional transit gateway, or hub, that
can be used to connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.

10
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:54,625
Target and virtual private gateways, which
are also VPN endpoints.

11
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,458
Site-to-Site VPN Features

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,541
You can configure Site-to-Site VPN using
the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface, AWS software development kits, or by using the Query API.

13
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:15,083
Site-to-Site VPN can support either IP v4 traffic or IP v6 traffic.

14
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:19,541
Site-to-Site VPN supports many common
configurations including:

15
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,666
A single Site-to-Site VPN connection.

16
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,750
A single Site-to-Site VPN connection with
a transit gateway.

17
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,958
Multiple Site-to-Site VPN connections.

18
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:34,208
Multiple Site-to-Site VPN connections with
a transit gateway.

19
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:38,625
Site-to-Site VPN connections using AWS
Direct Connect.

20
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:49,250
Other options include configuring a
private IP Site-to-Site VPN connection with AWS Direct Connect, and using AWS VPN Cloud Hub for multiple VPN connections.

21
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,416
Site-to-Site VPN Benefits

22
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:53,916
Security.

23
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:59,666
Data is transferred between your VPC and
your network routes over an encrypted VPN connection.

24
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:11,083
Instances in your VPC do not require a
public IP address to connect to resources on the other side of your Site-to-Site VPN connection, which reduces the risk of certain types of security exploits.

25
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:12,916
Resilience.

26
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:22,000
A Site-to-Site VPN connection consists of
two tunnels, each terminating in a different Availability Zone, to provide increased availability to your VPC.

27
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:30,750
If there is a device failure within AWS,
your VPN connection automatically fails over to the second tunnel so that your access isn't interrupted.

28
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,708
Reliability.

29
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:43,291
AWS provides various tools that you can
use to monitor a Site-to-Site VPN connection, such as AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Health Dashboard.

30
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:51,375
You can configure some of these tools to
automatically do the monitoring for you, providing insight into your network traffic with both logs and metrics.
