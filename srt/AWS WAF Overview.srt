00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,940
AWS WAF Overview.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,720
AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,960
web applications or APIs against common web exploits and bots.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,290
These threats can affect availability,

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,150
compromise security, or consume excessive resources.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,590
You can deploy AWS WAF on Amazon CloudFront and Application Load Balancer,

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,980
Amazon API Gateway, or AWS AppSync.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,620
AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications.

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,020
You can create security rules

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,360
that control bot traffic, block common attack patterns,

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,720
or filter out specific traffic patterns.

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,170
AWS WAF can be deployed in minutes.

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,000
You can get started quickly by using managed rules for AWS WAF,

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,840
a preconfigured set of rules managed by AWS or AWS Marketplace sellers.

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,960
You can also define

16
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,630
your own custom rules.

17
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,540
AWS WAF

18
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,590
provides a full-featured API

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,140
that you can use to automate the creation,

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,310
deployment, and maintenance of security rules.

21
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,550
With AWS WAF,

22
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,530
you pay only for what you use.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,680
The pricing is based on how many rules you deploy

24
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,220
and how many web requests your application receives.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,120
Here are the key benefits.

26
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,510
Agile protection against web attacks.

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,650
AWS WAF rule propagation and updates take under a minute.

28
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,280
So you can quickly update security across your environment when issues arise.

29
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,360
AWS WAF also supports hundreds of rules that you can use to inspect any

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,600
part of the web request with minimal latency impact to incoming traffic.

31
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,910
Save time with managed rules.

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,000
You can quickly get started

33
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,080
and save time

34
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,700
using managed rules for AWS WAF.

35
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,419
There are many rule types to choose from.

36
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,840
Managed rules are automatically updated

37
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,680
as new issues emerge so you can spend more time building applications.

38
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,660
Improved web traffic visibility.

39
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,680
AWS WAF

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,380
provides real-time metrics

41
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,360
and captures raw requests that include details about IP addresses,

42
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,780
geo locations,

43
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,990
Uniform Resource Identifiers, or URIs, user agents, and referrers.

44
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,920
AWS WAF is fully integrated with Amazon CloudWatch,

45
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,080
so you can set up custom alarms to notify you

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,650
when thresholds are exceeded

47
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,230
or particular attacks occur.

48
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,740
Ease of deployment and maintenance.

49
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,920
There is no additional software to deploy, DNS to configure,

50
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,140
SSL/TLS certificate to manage, or reverse proxy to set up.

51
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,620
Using AWS Firewall Manager, you can also centrally define, manage,

52
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,240
and reuse your AWS WAF rules.

53
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,080
AWS WAF Bot Control.

54
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,140
With AWS WAF Bot Control,

55
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,010
you get visibility and control over common

56
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,520
and pervasive bot traffic to your applications.

57
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,740
You can block or rate-limit traffic from pervasive bots.

58
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,390
Security integrated with how you develop applications.

59
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,430
Every feature in AWS WAF

60
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:36,740
can be configured by using either the AWS WAF API or the AWS Management Console.

61
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,140
DevOps teams can define application-specific rules that increase web security

62
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,930
at multiple points in the development process chain.
