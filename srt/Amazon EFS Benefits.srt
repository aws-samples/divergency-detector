00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) Benefits.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,190
Here are the key benefits.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,560
POSIX-compliant shared file storage.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,480
Amazon EFS enables you to control access

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,800
to your file systems through Portable Operating System Interface,

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,250
or POSIX, permissions.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,520
Amazon EFS provides secure access for

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,460
thousands of connections for Amazon EC2 instances

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,700
and on-premises servers simultaneously,

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,980
using a traditional file permissions model,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,600
file locking capabilities,

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,780
and hierarchical directory structure via the NFSv4 protocol.

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,490
Scalable performance.

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,910
Amazon EFS is designed to provide the throughput,

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,830
IOPS, and low latency needed for Linux workloads.

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,490
Throughput and IOPS scale as a file system grows

17
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,500
and can burst to higher throughput levels for short periods of time

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,550
to support the unpredictable performance needs of file workloads.

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,970
For the most demanding workloads,

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,780
Amazon EFS can support performance over 10 gigabytes per second

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,820
and more than 500,000 IOPS.

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,750
Dynamic elasticity.

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,450
Since capacity is elastic, there is no provisioning storage in advance required.

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,190
You simply create your file system. Amazon EFS

25
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,390
dynamically provides the storage capacity you need as you need it.

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,380
Amazon EFS is a fully managed service.

27
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,490
It manages the file storage infrastructure for you and provides a

28
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,300
simple interface allowing you to create and configure file systems quickly.

29
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,940
In seconds,

30
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,840
you can create a fully managed file system by using

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,380
the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK.

32
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,400
Cost-effective. With Amazon EFS storage, you pay only for what you use.

33
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:48,840
There are no minimum commitments or up-front fees. With the EFS lifecycle management,

34
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,010
you can automatically move files accessed less

35
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,840
frequently to a cost-optimized storage class,

36
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,950
reducing file storage costs by up to 92%.

37
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,620
You can also use AWS Budgets

38
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,590
to monitor your file system costs.

39
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,170
Security and compliance.

40
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,170
Amazon EFS allows you to securely

41
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,560
access your files using your existing security infrastructure.

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,800
You can control network access to your file systems

43
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,110
using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, or Amazon VPC, security group rules.

44
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,290
And you can control application access to your

45
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,800
file systems using AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM,

46
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,690
policies and EFS access points.

47
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,060
EFS access points allow you to create

48
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,750
application-specific directory and permissions.

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,510
It enforces the use of an operating system

50
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,360
user and group or restricting access to a directory in the file system.

51
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:46,300
In addition, you can use AWS Identity and Access Management, or AWS IAM,

52
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,600
policies to enforce that

53
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,560
specific applications use a specific access point.

54
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,690
You can also secure your data by encrypting your data at rest and in transit.

55
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,840
Amazon EFS

56
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,000
satisfies many eligibility and compliance requirements

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,990
to help you meet your regulatory needs.
