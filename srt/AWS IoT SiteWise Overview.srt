AWS IoT SiteWise Overview

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:16,958
AWS IoT Sitewise is a managed service that
industrial enterprises use to collect, store, organize, and visualize thousands of sensor data streams from Internet of Things, or IoT devices across multiple industrial facilities.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,125
AWS IoT SiteWise includes software that
runs on a gateway device that sits onsite in a facility.

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,875
The software continually collects data and
sends it to the cloud.

5
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:37,083
With AWS IoT SiteWise, you can focus on
using your data to detect and fix equipment issues, spot inefficiencies, and improve production output.

Key Features

7
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,041
Sitewise Edge

8
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:53,916
AWS IoT SiteWise includes AWS IoT SiteWise
Edge, on-premises software used to collect, organize, process, and monitor equipment data locally before sending it to AWS.

9
00:00:54,208 --> 00:01:03,416
SiteWise Edge runs on local hardware, such
as third-party industrial gateways and computers, or on AWS Outposts and AWS Snow Family compute devices.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,875
SiteWise Edge uses AWS IoT Greengrass,
which provides a local software runtime environment for edge devices to help build, deploy, and manage applications.

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Time series storage

12
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:23,583
Use AWS IoT SiteWise to store industrial
data generated from your equipment in a fast and scalable time series data store.

13
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:33,458
AWS IoT SiteWise storage supports two
tiers for equipment data: a hot tier optimized for real-time applications and a cold tier optimized for analytical applications.

14
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:43,791
AWS IoT SiteWise helps you reduce storage
costs by keeping recent data in the hot tier and moving historical data, based on policies, to a cost-optimized storage tier.

15
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:45,791
Asset modeling

16
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:53,833
Use AWS IoT SiteWise to build models of
your physical operations that represent your assets, processes, and facilities.

17
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,375
These models help you understand
industrial data in the context of your equipment.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,916
After your models are created, you can
define an asset hierarchy to accurately represent relationships between devices and equipment within a single facility or across multiple facilities.

19
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,916
Use cases

20
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,708
Increase production efficiencies

21
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:20,458
Organize sensor data streams from multiple
production lines and facilities to drive efficiencies across locations.

22
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,708
Improve manufacturing operations

23
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:32,166
Monitor performance metrics from
manufacturing lines, assembly robots, and factory equipment to discover and act on opportunities for improvement.

24
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,958
Optimize asset maintenance

25
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,291
Prevent, detect, and resolve equipment
issues faster through remote asset monitoring, using historical and near-real-time data.
