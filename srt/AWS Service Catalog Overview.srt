00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
AWS Service Catalog Overview.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,700
Organizations can use the AWS Service Catalog

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,000
to create and manage catalogs of IT services

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,500
that are approved by Amazon Web Services.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,970
These IT services can include everything from virtual machine images,

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,700
servers, software, databases, and more

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,910
to complete multi-tier application architectures.

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,500
With AWS Service Catalog,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,340
organizations can centrally manage commonly deployed IT services,

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,780
which helps them achieve consistent governance

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,690
and meet compliance requirements.

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,020
First, let's understand some key concepts.

13
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,800
What is a product

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,600
and what is a portfolio in AWS Service Catalog?

15
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:53,360
A product is an IT service that is available for deployment on AWS.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,180
A product consists of one or more AWS resources.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,250
A portfolio

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,470
is a collection of products that contain configuration information.

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,740
Portfolios help manage who can use specific products

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,030
and how they can use them.

21
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,070
AWS Service Catalog supports two types of users,

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,220
catalog administrators and end users.

23
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,610
Catalog administrators

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,890
manage a catalog of products such as applications and services.

25
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,820
Administrators organize products into portfolios, set constraints,

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,810
and grant access to end users.

27
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,840
End users are the users who receive AWS credentials

28
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,140
from their IT department or manager.

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,040
Then end users can access and use the AWS Management Console to

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,920
launch or deploy products to which they have been granted access.

31
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,020
Now, let's go through some of the key benefits.

32
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,190
Standardization.

33
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,760
You can use AWS Service Catalog to administer and manage

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,630
approved assets by restricting where the product can be launched,

35
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,280
the type of instance that can be used, and many other configuration options.

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,530
As a result,

37
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,490
you can standardize product provisioning for your entire organization.

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,000
Self-service discovery and launch.

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,030
End users can browse the listings of products available for them,

40
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,280
locate the products they want to use,

41
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,770
and launch it all on their own as a provisioned product.

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,840
Fine-grain access control.

43
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,310
AWS Service Catalog administrators assemble portfolios

44
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,510
of products from their catalog,

45
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,510
add constraints and resource tags to be used at provisioning.

46
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,400
Then catalog administrators grant access to the portfolio through

47
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,600
AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM, users and groups.

48
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,980
Extensibility and version control.

49
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,280
AWS Service Catalog administrators can add a product

50
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,600
to any number of portfolios and restrict it without creating another copy.

51
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,350
Updating the product to a new version

52
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,650
propagates the update to all products in every portfolio that references it.
