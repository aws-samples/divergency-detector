Amazon MSK Overview.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,220
Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka, or Amazon MSK,

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,530
is a fully managed service that helps you build

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,430
and run applications that use Apache Kafka to collect,

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,700
process, store, and analyze data at scale.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,340
Apache Kafka is a distributed datastore optimized for

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,320
ingesting and processing streaming data in real time.

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,400
Kafka provides three main functions to its users.

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,460
Publish and subscribe to streams of records,

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,240
effectively store streams of records in the

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,320
order in which the records were generated,

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,590
and process streams of records in real time.

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,320
The streaming data solution for Amazon MSK helps you address

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,610
real-time streaming use cases such as capturing high volume application

15
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,720
log files,

16
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,560
analyzing website click streams, processing

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,830
database event streams, tracking financial transactions,

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,520
aggregating social media feeds, and continuously delivering to a data lake.

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,530
Features.

20
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,220
High availability.

21
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,230
Amazon MSK clusters are distributed across multiple Availability Zones

22
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,210
with three AZs as the default.

23
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,120
These clusters are also supported by the Amazon MSK service-level agreement

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,610
and by automated systems that detect and respond

25
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,570
to issues within the cluster infrastructure

26
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,040
and Apache Kafka software.

27
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,170
Highly secure.

28
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,890
Your Apache Kafka clusters run in a Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC,

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,880
managed by Amazon MSK.

30
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,570
A cluster authentication is streamlined by using AWS Identity and

31
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,900
Access Management roles or user policies to control access.

32
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,350
Amazon MSK also encrypts your data at

33
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,670
rest without special configuration or third-party tools.

34
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,810
