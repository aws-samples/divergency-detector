00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,560
AWS

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,148
IoT Greengrass is an Internet of Things, or IOT, open

4
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:10,899
source edge runtime and cloud service that helps you build,

5
00:00:10,909 --> 00:00:13,420
deploy, and manage device software.

6
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:14,970
Customers use AWS

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,879
IoT Greengrass for their IoT applications on millions of devices in homes,

8
00:00:19,889 --> 00:00:22,379
factories, vehicles, and businesses.

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,600
You can program your devices to act locally on the data

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,139
that they generate, execute predictions based on machine learning models,

11
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:31,620
filter and aggregate device data, and transmit

12
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:33,779
only necessary information to the cloud.

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,669
Key Benefits

14
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,200
Manage IOT applications at scale

15
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,099
using

16
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,650
AWS

17
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:42,000
IOT Greengrass.

18
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,919
You can remotely deploy and manage device software on millions of devices,

19
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,150
configuring the software to a subset of devices or to all devices at once.

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,099
You can also organize your devices in groups.

21
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:55,470
Over the Air Updates.

22
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:57,509
You have the ability to update

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:57,919
AWS

24
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,860
IoT Greengrass core software on IoT Greengrass devices.

25
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:03,580
You can use the

26
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,610
AWS management console APIs

27
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:09,639
or command-line interface to update the version of IoT Greengrass cores

28
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,339
or components running on your devices in order to deploy security updates,

29
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:16,360
bug fixes, and new IoT Greengrass features.

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,250
Greengrass software catalog.

31
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:22,389
The Greengrass software catalog is a collection of

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,889
IoT Greengrass components developed by the Greengrass community.

33
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,930
Instead of developing device components for each required capability,

34
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,449
you can now quickly install, use, and modify components from a

35
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:37,430
list of prebuilt software components to kickstart your IoT edge application.

36
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:39,279
Key features

37
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:42,809
Local processing for AWS Lambda

38
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,180
Using

39
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:44,730
AWS

40
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,750
IoT Greengrass, you can run

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,650
AWS Lambda functions on a device to respond quickly to local events,

42
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,529
interact with local resources, and process data to

43
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,160
minimize the cost of transmitting data to the cloud.

44
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,209
Local messaging.

45
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,040
AWS

46
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,449
IoT Greengrass provides messaging between the IoT

47
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,839
Greengrass core and devices using the AWS

48
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:09,380
IoT Device SDK on the local network which facilitates communication.

49
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,500
Even when there is no connection to

50
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:11,520
AWS,

51
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:15,789
your devices can process messages and deliver them to another device

52
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,509
or to the cloud based on business rules that you define.

53
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:20,919
Machine Learning Inference.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,330
AWS

55
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:24,839
IoT Greengrass ML inference is a feature

56
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,309
that helps you perform machine learning inference locally

57
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,690
on IoT Greengrass devices by using models that are built and trained in the cloud.

58
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,830
This means you won't incur data transfer costs or

59
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:38,369
increase latency for applications that use machine learning inference.
