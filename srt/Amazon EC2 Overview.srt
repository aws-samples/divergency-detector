00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,569
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Overview.

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:06,050
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2,

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,600
is a web service that provides

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,840
secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,920
It eliminates your need

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,470
for up-front hardware investment,

7
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:16,068
so you can develop and deploy applications faster.

8
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:21,350
You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need.

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,180
Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down within minutes

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,409
to handle changes or spikes in requirements,

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,569
reducing your need to forecast traffic.

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,520
It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and

13
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:37,759
lets you run on Amazon's proven, reliable, and scalable computing environment.

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,659
Amazon EC2 is hosted in multiple locations worldwide comprised of

15
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,360
AWS Regions which consists of at least three Availability Zones.

16
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:49,470
This computing environment provides high availability

17
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,389
with service-level agreement, or SLA,

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,860
commitment of 99.99% availability for each Amazon EC2 region.

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,619
In addition, security at AWS is our top priority.

20
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,130
AWS is built to meet the requirements

21
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:05,559
of the most security-sensitive organizations.

22
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:10,230
First, let's go through some of the Amazon EC2 basics.

23
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,660
What is an instance?

24
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:14,720
An instance is a virtual server in the cloud.

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,690
Amazon EC2 provides a wide selection of instance

26
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,639
types to enable you to choose the CPU,

27
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:22,910
memory, storage, networking capacity,

28
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,639
and GPU for your applications.

29
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,120
Here are the instance type categories:

30
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,599
General-purpose instances

31
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:33,500
are instances that provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources.

32
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,180
Compute-optimized instances are optimized for compute-intensive workloads.

33
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,970
Memory-optimized instances.

34
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,879
These instances are for memory-intensive workloads

35
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:46,139
that process large datasets in memory.

36
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,089
Storage-optimized instances.

37
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,470
They are designed for workloads that require sequential read and

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,510
write access to very large datasets on local storage.

39
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:58,720
Accelerated computing instances.

40
00:01:58,949 --> 00:02:02,559
These are GPU instances that use hardware accelerators.

41
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:05,360
HPC optimized instances.

42
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:09,460
These instances are optimized for high-performance computing workloads.

43
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:13,410
These instance types are optimized to fit different use cases.

44
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,000
Here is just one of the many examples for each instance type.

45
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:18,970
In addition,

46
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:22,029
each instance type includes one or more instance sizes,

47
00:02:22,029 --> 00:02:23,889
allowing you to scale your resources

48
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:25,940
to the requirements of your target workload.

49
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,509
AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image.

50
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,539
An AMI provides the information required to launch an instance.

51
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,360
It is a template that contains

52
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,160
a software configuration such as an operating system,

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,690
applications, and an application server.

54
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,289
You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance.

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,490
You can launch a single instance or multiple instances from an AMI.
