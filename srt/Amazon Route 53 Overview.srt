00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,230
Welcome to an Overview of Amazon Route 53.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,160
Amazon Route 53

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,520
is a highly available

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,750
and scalable cloud domain name system,

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,400
that provides a reliable and cost effective way

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,140
for developers and businesses

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,660
to route end users to internet applications.

8
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,850
This is achieved by translating names like www.example.com

9
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,080
into numeric IP addresses like

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,740
192.0.2.1,

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,180
that enable computers to connect to each other.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,700
Amazon Route 53 is also fully compliant

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,810
with internet protocol version six, or IPv6.

14
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,000
Amazon Route 53

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,500
connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS

16
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,760
such as Amazon S3 buckets or Amazon Elastic Load Balances,

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,060
and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.

18
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,970
Amazon Route 53 traffic flow

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,260
simplifies traffic management globally

20
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,170
through a variety of rooting types,

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,030
including latency based routing

22
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,610
that routes uses to the AWS region that provides the lowest possible latency.

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,500
Geo DNS routing

24
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,100
that routes users to a particular endpoint that you

25
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,900
specify based on the end user's geographic location.

26
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,870
Geoproximity routing

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,140
that routes traffic to your resources based on

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,420
the geographic location of your users and your resources.

29
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,480
Weighted round robin routing

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,220
that specifies the frequency

31
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,430
with which different DNS responses

32
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,070
are returned to end users.

33
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,710
And Failover routing

34
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,960
that lets you route traffic to a resource when

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,710
the resource is healthy, or to a different resource

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,780
when the first resource is unhealthy.

37
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,370
You can also use Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,290
to configure DNS health checks,

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,400
that continuously monitor your application's ability to recover from failures

40
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,340
and control application recovery.

41
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,650
Amazon Route 53 has a simple web services interface

42
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,620
that lets you get started in minutes.

43
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,560
You start by creating an Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone

44
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,130
that can store DNS records for your domain.

45
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,280
Once you create a hosted zone,

46
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,950
you receive four Route 53 name servers

47
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,430
to help ensure a high level of availability for your applications.

48
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,220
If you don't have a domain name, you can create one with route 53

49
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,440
or transfer an existing domain that you already own.

50
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,160
So you can conveniently manage your domain names

51
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,840
and DNS configuration in a single location.

52
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,990
Your hosted zone will be initially populated with a basic set of DNS records,

53
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,100
including four virtual name servers

54
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,080
that will answer queries for your domain.

55
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,350
You can add,

56
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,590
delete or change records in this set

57
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,160
using the AWS Management Console

58
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,320
or by calling the change resource record set API.

59
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,570
Amazon Route 53

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,970
supports many DNS record types,

61
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,330
including a records that route traffic to a resource

62
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,620
such as a web server

63
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,510
and CNAME records that allow you to redirect one domain name to another.

64
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,780
Route 53 also includes alias records

65
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,230
that let you route traffic to selected AWS resources

66
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,690
like Amazon S3,

67
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,150
and Amazon CloudFront.
