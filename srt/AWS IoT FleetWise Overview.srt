AWS IoT FleetWise Overview

2
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:11,125
AWS IoT FleetWise is used to collect,
organize, and store vehicle data in a standardized way for analysis in the cloud.

3
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:17,708
After the data is in the cloud, you can
use it for applications that analyze vehicle fleet health and resources.

4
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:25,041
This analysis can help you more quickly
identify potential maintenance issues or make in-vehicle infotainment systems smarter.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,374
You can also feed the data into machine
learning models that improve autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems.

Key Features

7
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:37,583
Edge Agent

8
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:43,958
The Edge Agent for AWS IoT FleetWise
facilitates communication between a vehicle and the cloud.

9
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:56,875
You can develop your Edge Agent by using
the Edge Agent Reference Implementation for AWS IoT Fleetwise, a fully functional piece of embedded software designed for vehicle data collection that can run on most embedded Linux-based platforms.

10
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,041
Global signal catalog

11
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:08,291
AWS IoT FleetWise provides a centralized
repository of standardized vehicle sensors and signals for your vehicle models.

12
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:12,583
You can save time by reusing signals when
creating new vehicle models.

13
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,875
Rules-based data collection

14
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:23,291
To transfer only the data signals that you
want to the cloud, AWS IoT FleetWise can apply rules that you define.

15
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:33,458
To start, you can define vehicle
attributes and the sensors associated with a vehicleâ€™s make, model, and trim (such as engine temperature, vehicle speed, and parking assist system).

16
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:42,666
You can then define rules and events for
when to transfer the sensor data based on parameters, such as changes to temperature or speed for a certain vehicle type.

17
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,375
Use cases

18
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,375
Maintain EV battery health

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,541
Monitor EV battery health and charge
levels and improve range estimates for drivers.

20
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,791
Enhance the in-cabin experience

21
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:03,625
Use data from in-vehicle infotainment
systems to make services, audiovisual content, and features more relevant.

22
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,791
Improve fleet operations

23
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,208
Use insights from commercial fleet data to
analyze driver safety, vehicle uptime, and maintenance schedules.
